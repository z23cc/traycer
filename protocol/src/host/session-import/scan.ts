/**
 * `sessionImport.scan@1.0` - versioned streaming-RPC contract for discovering
 * the native CLI sessions a user could bring into Traycer.
 *
 * Subscribing makes the host read the vendors' own session directories
 * (`~/.claude/projects`, `~/.codex/sessions`, …) - the ONLY moment it ever
 * does; there is no background scanning. Reads are metadata-only and strictly
 * read-only: a scan never writes, moves, or deletes anything the vendor owns.
 *
 * Groups are emitted AFTER the walk, one frame per folder, rather than as one
 * list. They cannot stream during the walk: a folder's membership spans
 * providers, so "this folder is complete" is not knowable until every provider
 * has been walked. The frame that genuinely arrives early is `providerFailed`,
 * which is sent the moment a provider gives up - which is what lets the wizard
 * grey that provider out while the rest of the scan is still running.
 *
 * Server frames:
 *
 * - `started`        - emitted once, before any directory is opened.
 * - `group`          - one repo folder's worth of candidates, complete. Sent
 *                      after every provider has been walked.
 * - `providerFailed` - one provider could not be scanned at all; the others
 *                      keep walking. The one frame that is live: it is sent
 *                      during the walk rather than as a field on `complete`, so
 *                      the wizard can grey that provider's section out WHILE
 *                      the scan is still running, which is exactly when the
 *                      user is looking at it.
 * - `complete`       - terminal frame; carries the totals the header shows.
 * - `pong`           - heartbeat response.
 *
 * Client frames:
 *
 * - `ping` - heartbeat. No application client frames.
