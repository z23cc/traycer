 * # The windowed `chat.subscribe` line
 *
 * Frames for a transcript the host serves in PIECES rather than whole.
 *
 * Today's snapshot embeds the entire persisted chat - 20-40 MB on a long one -
 * and every history mutation re-sends it. These schemas replace that with a
 * bounded snapshot, a row skeleton the client holds for the whole session, and
 * ranges of bodies fetched on demand.
 *
 * ## Version implies behaviour; there is no `windowed` flag
 *
 * A peer that negotiates this line gets windowed frames, full stop. There is
 * deliberately no per-connection opt-in and no full-snapshot mode on the same
 * line: two behaviours behind one version is the arrangement where a host and
 * a client can each believe the other is in the mode it is not. A peer too old
 * for this negotiates an older minor and the host serves it whole snapshots
 * from its own fallback path.
 *
 * ## The 1 MiB frame invariant
 *
 * The relay reclassifies any body over 1 MiB onto the BULK QoS lane
 * PER-MESSAGE (`host-transport/chunking.ts`), where it can be reordered
 * against INTERACTIVE deltas. Same-pump ordering is the whole safety argument
 * for serving ranges on the subscribe stream, so it holds only while every
 * frame here stays under that threshold. Two consequences are structural
 * rather than advisory:
 *
 * - the skeleton is delivered in CHUNKS, never as one array, because a
 *   20k-row skeleton is ~1-2 MB;
 * - `indexChanged` carries a DELTA, never a fresh index.
 *
 * ## The coordinate
 *
 * A row is addressed by its ORDINAL - its index in canonical order
 * (`persistence/chat-transcript/row-order.ts`) under a given
 * `transcriptEpoch`. Ordinals are only meaningful relative to their epoch, so
 * every frame that names one also names the epoch, and every response carries
 * the row IDS it is answering for. A client that receives a range whose ids do
 * not match its skeleton at that span discards it and refetches. That is what
 * turns a missed coordinate invalidation into a wasted round trip instead of bodies
 * rendered under the wrong rows.

 * loses nothing, because a chat it cannot read has no row for it to jump to.
 *
 * The ordinal is an index into the row enumeration the skeleton publishes, so
 * the client feeds it straight to its hydration planner - but only after
 * checking the `epoch` it came stamped with, which is what the rest of this
 * doc is about.
 *
 * ## Why an ordinal alone is not an answer
 *
 * An ordinal is a coordinate, and a coordinate means nothing without the space
 * it is in. This is a unary RPC on a different connection from the stream, so
 * between the host numbering the row and the client consuming the number the
 * transcript can be re-based - a restore, a checkpoint, a compaction. Every one
 * of those advances the epoch, and the client is then handed a position in a
 * space it has left. Nothing downstream can detect that: the ordinal is
 * in-range, the planner fetches it, and the reader is scrolled to a plausible
 * wrong row. So the space rides with the coordinate and the client refuses an
 * answer stamped with an epoch it is not in.
 *
 * The EPOCH and not the located row's id, and the distinction is worth stating
 * because an earlier draft of this doc argued against a second identifier
 * outright. That argument was about ANCHOR RESOLUTION - once the row is
 * hydrated the client resolves the anchor through its own rendered models
 * exactly as it does for a warm target, so a row id would ride the wire with no
 * reader. It was never about staleness, which is a different question and needs
 * an answer. The epoch is the one that answers it completely: within an epoch
 * an existing ordinal keeps naming the same row (an `appended` change only adds
 * beyond it, an `updated` moves no ordinal), and anything that MOVES a row is a
 * `reindexed`, which advances the epoch by the same predicate. A row id would
 * be a second, weaker check on top of a complete one.

   * Every setup lifecycle window in the chat, in chronological order.
   *
   * ## Why this is chat-level and not per-row context
   *
   * A setup card's row id is `setup-card:<chatId>:<windowIndex>:<createdAt>`,
   * and `windowIndex` is a position in a partition over the chat's WHOLE event
   * log. A client hydrating one card in isolation re-runs that partition over
   * that window's events alone, renumbers the card to 0, and can revive a
   * historically closed window as active.
   *
   * `TranscriptRowContext` carries the right answers and cannot deliver them,
   * because the lookup is CIRCULAR: the context map is keyed by row id, and a
   * client that renumbered the window computes a different row id, so it cannot
   * find the entry that would have corrected it. Every repair keyed on the row
   * id has that shape.
   *
   * So the answer travels as chat-level aux, keyed on `createdAt` - which the
   * client derives identically from the window's own events, because it is the
   * earliest setup-event timestamp IN that window. That is what breaks the
   * circle: the match key is local, the index is not.
   *
   * Bounded by the number of setup lifecycles a chat has had - one for most
   * chats, a handful for a heavily re-bound one - never by rows.

 * Never a fresh index: on a long chat that would be a megabyte-scale frame per
 * mutation, which is both the cost this feature exists to remove and a
 * violation of the 1 MiB invariant.
 *
 * ## One frame carries an ARRAY of these
 *
 * A single mutation is routinely two of these at once: a turn finishing APPENDS
 * rows and UPDATES the streaming row that preceded them with its final size and
 * usage. They ride one `indexChanged` frame together (see that frame's
 * `changes` field) rather than two frames, because after applying `appended`
 * alone the client's skeleton LENGTH already equals the frame's `rowCount` - so
 * a lost or dropped second frame leaves an index that looks complete and is
 * silently wrong at one entry, which neither side can detect. Same-pump
 * ordering makes that unlikely, not impossible: backpressure compaction
 * explicitly drops queued `indexChanged` frames.
 *
 * Within one frame the members' ordinals are disjoint by construction -
 * `appended` names only ordinals at or past the old length, `updated` only
 * ordinals below it - so they may be applied in either order and the frame is
 * atomic.
 *
 * The three cases are not arbitrary - they are what the store can actually do
 * to the row set:
 *
 * - `appended` is the steady state. A new row at the tail shifts no existing
 *   ordinal, so the client appends and nothing it holds is invalidated.
 * - `updated` is a row rewritten in place (a streaming row finalizing, an
 *   image resolving). Ordinals are untouched; the named rows' bodies are
 *   stale and the client drops them. Inclusion IS the staleness signal - there
 *   is no per-row write stamp to compare, and none is needed.
 * - `reindexed` is the honest answer for anything that MOVES rows: a
 *   checkpoint trim removing rows, or a restore re-appending one whose
 *   timestamp seats it mid-history. Every ordinal after the change is
 *   different, so rather than describe the shift the host declares the index
 *   invalid and the client re-requests it. These are user-initiated history
 *   mutations - rare, and worth a refetch to avoid a delta format whose edge
 *   cases nobody would exercise often enough to trust.
