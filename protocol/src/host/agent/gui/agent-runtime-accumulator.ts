 * `InterviewResolvedEvent`/`InterviewErroredEvent` are `{ blockId, timestamp,
 * parentBlockId, type }` plus their payload - there is no event id to key
 * settlement on. So this derives one from everything that does identify the
 * event, and the derivation has a known collision: two DISTINCT runtime events
 * of the same kind, for the same block, in the same millisecond produce the
 * same id, and the reducer reads the second as a replay of the first.
 *
 * That collision is contained rather than fixed, and deliberately not hidden
 * behind a random id. A random id would make every replay - hydration,
 * reconciliation, a reconnect re-delivering the same event - look like a NEW
 * settlement, which is a permanent correctness bug traded for a
 * same-millisecond edge case. The containment is the reducer's authority
 * rules: a colliding second event cannot install its own answers over a
 * canonical winner in any case (see `applyInterviewSettlement`'s payload
 * gating), so the observable loss is limited to a distinct diagnostic code
 * that lands in the same millisecond as its twin.
 *
 * The real fix is an id on the event itself, which is a change to the
 * runtime-event contract (a new `chat.subscribe` minor and an adapter
 * obligation), not something this function can invent. Until then, a
 * host-originated settlement supplies its own durable id and never comes here
 * - which is the path every user-visible settlement actually takes.
