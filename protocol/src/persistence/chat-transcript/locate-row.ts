/**
 * # Locating a row the client cannot name
 *
 * A cross-tile jump has to end at an ORDINAL: on the windowed line the target
 * row is routinely cold, and the only way to get a cold row fetched is to name
 * where it sits. For some target kinds the client derives the row id itself - a
 * delivered USER message's row id IS its message id, an event's is
 * `chatTranscriptEventRowId` - and then reads the ordinal straight off the
 * skeleton it already holds.
 *
 * Four kinds cannot be derived that way, and they are the reason this module
 * exists. A `block` target is identified by walking the RENDERED segment tree,
 * a `sent-message` target by matching an `agentMessageSend` enrichment inside
 * one, and a `receipt` target by matching an `agentMessageReceipt` - and a
 * cold row has no rendered models at all. So the client can
 * neither find the row nor learn that it exists, and waiting for it to appear
 * deadlocks: the scroll is what drives hydration and the scroll is what is
 * being held back.
 *
 * A `message` target is the fourth, and it fails for a different reason worth
 * stating separately, because "a message id is a row id" holds often enough to
 * look like a rule. It is one only for USER records. An assistant record is
 * projected into TURN-KEYED rows (`assistant:<turnKey>`, and one per slice when
 * the turn is split), and keeps its durable id only as the rendered model's
 * `persistentMessageId` - so the id-as-row-id lookup silently misses, and the
 * jump waits forever for a row that can never carry that id. The client's own
 * fallback reads `persistentMessageId` off its RENDERED models, which puts it
 * back in the cold-row hole above. Terminal notifications point at exactly this
 * durable id, so the miss lands on "take me to the turn that just finished" in
 * a chat long enough for that turn to be cold.
 *
 * The host holds the records, so the host answers. This is that answer.
 *
 * ## Why it is the same enumeration, not a similar one
 *
 * This takes the PROJECTED ROWS rather than the records to project, and both
 * halves of that matter.
 *
 * It is what makes the ordinal correct: the rows are the array
 * `buildRowSkeleton` maps over, so an index into them names the same row the
 * client's skeleton has at that index - by construction, not by two
 * implementations agreeing today. That is the discipline `row-projection.ts`
 * records under "consume, do not mirror": a predicate that can disagree with
 * its consumer does not get to have one, and a *position* that can disagree is
 * worse, because it fails by scrolling somewhere plausible instead of failing
 * visibly.
 *
 * And it is what keeps this cheap. The host holds these rows already
 * (`TranscriptViewCache`), so a locate costs a walk rather than a re-projection
 * of the whole history - which is the per-jump version of exactly the
 * full-history scan the windowed line exists to delete.
 *
 * ## Blocks are flat here and nested only when drawn
 *
 * A subagent's tool calls are persisted as ordinary blocks on the assistant
 * record with a `parentBlockId`; the nesting is a rendering-time grouping.
 * `planAssistantTurnRows` enumerates every block of a turn without regard to
 * that field, so each block - nested or not - belongs to exactly one slice, and
 * a direct block-to-row map covers a nested tool card without walking parents.
 */
