/**
 * The single literal version of the chat-sync publication contract.
 *
 * Deliberately its own module, importing nothing but Zod, so the registered
 * payload schemas (`_internal/chat-sync-schemas.ts`), the registry entries,
 * and the writers (`head.ts` / `shard.ts`) can all bind to the SAME literal
 * without a dependency cycle.
 *
 * **One version line for both records.** `chat-head` and `chat-shard` are two
 * halves of one publication: a shard embeds the same message / block / event
 * sub-schemas the head's core is built from, and a reader that gates on the
 * head then parses the shards it names. Every change that moves one moves the
 * other, so they bump together, always - the same argument that put
 * `chat-snapshot` and its increment on one line in the v1 design.
 *
 * Why a literal rather than the generic `{major, minor}` schema: a payload's
 * `schemaVersion` is self-identifying - it is what a repair verb, an orphan
 * sweep, or a clone target trusts when a downloaded object is detached from
 * the row that pointed at it. A generic schema lets a v1.0 parser accept a
 * payload claiming `{major: 99, minor: 77}`, which makes that field worthless
 * exactly when it matters. Pinning it means a payload can only ever claim the
 * version of the contract that accepted it.
 *
 * A new minor adds new contracts with their own literal here (`z.literal(1)`
 * for 1.1, and so on) alongside their registry entries.
 *
 * **1.2** carries canonical interview settlement: the interview content block
 * gained `outcome`, `draftAnswers`, `settlement`, `diagnostics` and `delivery`,
 * and each interview answer gained `selection`. Every one of those is
 * `.default(...)`-ed, so a 1.1 record parses unchanged, and §2/§3 of
 * `COMPATIBILITY.md` (the passthrough's `raw` re-emission and residual capture)
 * already make a 1.1 reader's re-publication of a 1.2 chat mechanically
 * lossless - which is why `CHAT_SYNC_1_1_READER_FLOOR` is NOT raised and a 1.2
 * head still stamps `minReaderVersion: null`. The bump exists because the
 * coupled-bump ritual requires the record minor for a `chat.subscribe` field
 * that also lands in a publication (these rode `chat.subscribe@1.7`), and
 * because a payload's self-identifying version is what a detached repair
 * candidate is trusted on.

// 1.3 adds `chat.imported` to `KNOWN_CHAT_EVENT_TYPES`. A new chat-event type
// is a MINOR here and only here: the unknown-variant passthrough
// (`passthrough.ts`) is what lets an older reader meet the event, keep it whole
// in `raw`, and re-publish it unchanged - the mechanism `COMPATIBILITY.md`
// names as reclassifying this class of addition from breaking to additive.
// (Renumbered from 1.2 when main's interview-settlement bump took that minor.)
// 1.3 also drops `outerHtml` and the raw `attributes` map from the browser
// annotation record (root cause H: page content in collaborator-readable chat
// persistence); both fields are unreleased, so this takes no bump of its own.
//
// 1.3 also carries `tool_call.agentMessageReceipt` (the receiver-side message
// id a `traycer_send_message` call landed as - a `chat.subscribe@1.7+` field
// that lands in a publication). It rides this still-unreleased minor rather
// than opening 1.4: `host-v1.2.0` shipped chat-sync 1.1, so 1.3 is already the
// next line a released reader will meet. Defaulted `null`, so a 1.1 record
// parses unchanged and residual capture (§3) carries it through an older
// publisher losslessly - `CHAT_SYNC_1_1_READER_FLOOR` stays where it is.
