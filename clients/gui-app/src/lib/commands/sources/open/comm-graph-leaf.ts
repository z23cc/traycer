/**
 * Opener leaf for the per-epic communication graph.
 *
 * A plain leaf rather than a category with a sub-page: the graph is
 * epic-scoped and singular, and it needs no host pick because the tile itself
 * subscribes to every host the epic's agents live on.
 *
 * Routed through the SINGLETON opener delegate, not the default one: the tile
 * id is computed from the epic, so the ordinary "fresh non-deduped instance"
 * opener would mint a second tab sharing that content id - and therefore
 * sharing the persisted viewport, so panning one graph would move the other.
 * Invoking this twice focuses the open graph instead.
