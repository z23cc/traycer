/**
 * Whether an update is genuinely EXECUTING right now — the only thing that may
 * hold a page-wide lifecycle gate.
 *
 * This exists because the coarse `updateProgress` field cannot answer it, and
 * the difference is a shipped-defect-sized gap. Ticket 04's derivation maps a
 * PARKED attempt (`waiting-for-work`, `waiting-to-activate`) to
 * `{state:"updating"}` — correctly, for its own purpose: bytes or an activation
 * really are still pending, and calling it `failed` would be worse. But a
 * consumer that reads "updating" as "a mutation is in flight, lock the page"
 * then locks it for the entire life of the park, and `waiting-to-activate` is
 * designed to survive a reboot and sit for a week.
 *
 * The result would be the exact inversion the ticket forbids twice: a parked
 * update disabling Restart, Diagnostics and the service verbs — while the
 * restart it is waiting for is the user's only way out. A banner may inform and
 * may offer **Force restart…**; it may never be the thing standing between a
 * person and their host.
 *
 * So: `execution === "active"` only. Parked is not executing. Terminal is not
 * executing. `unknown` is not executing either — and that last one is a
 * deliberate fail-OPEN rather than fail-closed, which is worth stating because
 * it inverts this codebase's usual instinct. The risk of leaving controls live
 * during an unobserved update is a refused or queued mutation; the risk of
 * locking them on a stale reading is a host nobody can recover, indefinitely,
 * with no way to clear it. Only the second is unrecoverable, so `unknown`
 * leaves the controls alone.
 *
 * Note what this does NOT gate: starting a conflicting UPDATE. A parked attempt
 * absolutely should stop a second install being launched over it — that is the
 * contender boundary's job on the host, and it refuses with `already-updating`.
 * This predicate is only about the surrounding lifecycle controls.
 *
 * `updating` — the coarse `updateProgress` marker projected beside a `none`
 * attempt — is deliberately in the fail-open arm with `unknown`, for the same
 * reason `unknown` is. The marker is a file the legacy updater writes before
 * it starts and deletes when it finishes; it carries no liveness, and a host
 * keeps serving a fresh `{state:"updating"}` for as long as that file exists,
 * which after an updater crash or hang is forever. A gate held by it would be
 * the unrecoverable case above with a different name: Restart, Diagnostics
 * and the service verbs disabled indefinitely by an update nobody is running.
 * The marker informs (a card, a moving bar); it never stands between a
 * person and their host.
