 * a connection. The borrow enforces that structurally
 * ({@link tryAcquireReadyRemoteSession} has no session factory to call), so
 * this module's job is only to avoid re-introducing a dial by some other route
 * — which is why it takes no `HostClient`. A `HostClient` for an unconnected
 * host is precisely the thing that would build a transport.
 *
 * `null` means "declined, nothing observed": no borrowable session, or the read
 * failed. Both project `unknown`, never failure — a host we could not reach is
 * a host we know nothing about, not a host with a broken update.
