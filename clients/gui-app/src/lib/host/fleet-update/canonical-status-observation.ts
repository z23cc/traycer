/**
 * Turning a CANONICAL `host.status` query into an observation — freshness
 * included, rather than assumed.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE DEFECT THIS MODULE EXISTS TO MAKE UNREPEATABLE
 *
 * The selected-host Overview used to build its observation like this:
 *
 *     freshUntilMs: Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY,
 *     nowMs: statusQuery.dataUpdatedAt,
 *     connected: true,
 *
 * — with a comment explaining that freshness was judged elsewhere, by the
 * page's own live-source helpers. It was not. Those helpers demoted the BUSY
 * snapshot; nothing applied them to the update projection, so the two
 * projections read the same retained response and disagreed about it.
 *
 * The consequence was not cosmetic. A host that reported an active
 * `downloading` attempt and then went unreachable kept that reading forever:
 * TanStack retains the last successful response, an infinite freshness deadline
 * can never expire, and `nowMs` taken from `dataUpdatedAt` cannot outrun a
 * deadline derived from the same instant. The view stayed `downloading`,
 * `holdsLifecycleGate` stayed true, an open restart confirmation closed itself,
 * and the Doctor card's bridge restart stayed refused — indefinitely, on a host
 * whose only route back was the restart being blocked.
 *
 * That is the third instance of one class in this epic, after the parked-attempt
 * gate and Ticket 05's TOCTOU: **a fact consumed outside the conditions that
 * keep it true.** A correct predicate evaluated against a reading nobody is
 * still refreshing is not a guarantee, and the fix is never a second opinion
 * about the reading — it is to carry the conditions with the fact.
 *
 * So freshness is not asserted here, it is DERIVED, and the same derivation
 * serves the local banner, the selected Overview and the fleet's coalesced
 * reads. One function, three legs, no per-surface staleness rule to drift.
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
