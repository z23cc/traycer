/**
 * The ordinal a cross-tile jump target sits at, when only the host can say.
 *
 * The client resolves some jump targets itself and reads the ordinal off the
 * skeleton it already holds. Four kinds it cannot. A `block` anchor, a
 * `sent-message` anchor and a `receipt` anchor are all found by walking
 * RENDERED models, and a cold row has none. A `message` anchor naming an ASSISTANT record has no row id to
 * look up either way: those rows are turn-keyed, and the durable id survives
 * only as the rendered model's `persistentMessageId` - so the skeleton read
 * misses and the rendered read needs the very hydration being waited on.
 *
 * Waiting for such a row is a deadlock rather than a delay - the scroll drives
 * hydration and the scroll is what the unresolved jump is holding back - so the
 * host is asked where the row is and the answer feeds the same
 * `requestTranscriptOrdinal` channel every other cold target uses.
 *
 * Disabled by passing `target: null`, which is the ordinary state: the query
 * exists only for the beat between an unresolved jump and the row landing.
 *
 * ## The answer is a coordinate, so it is checked against the space
 *
 * This is a unary RPC on a different connection from the stream. Between the
 * host numbering the row and this hook returning the number the transcript can
 * be re-based - a restore, a checkpoint, a compaction - and an ordinal from a
 * superseded epoch is in-range, fetchable, and points at the wrong row. So the
 * caller passes the epoch its window is holding, the answer is discarded unless
 * the two agree, and the epoch is part of the cache key so a re-base re-asks
 * rather than re-serving. It is the same rule a `loadRange` response is subject
 * to, deliberately: one coordinate, one notion of when it is usable.
 *
 * ## Not retried, and not an error surface
 *
 * `retry: false` and no `onError` toast. `found: false` is an ordinary answer -
 * the block may belong to a turn a checkpoint removed - and an older host
 * rejects the method outright with `E_HOST_UNSUPPORTED`, which is the correct
 * degrade rather than a fault: that host serves the whole transcript, so the
 * row is never cold and the jump resolves on its own. Both cases land on the
 * same behavior the jump already has for a target that never arrives, which is
 * to time out quietly.
