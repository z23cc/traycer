/**
 * Best-known update state for every listed host, obtained WITHOUT causing a
 * single new connection.
 *
 * This is the Settings selector's whole data source, and its defining property
 * is negative: "the selector decorates every host with the best known state …
 * Settings does not silently connect to other hosts to improve their badges"
 * (experience doc, Flow B). So a host is only ever read over a session that
 * already exists, and every other host projects `unknown`, which the badge
 * renders as nothing at all.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ONE QUERY PER HOST, not one for the fleet — and the first version had it the
 * other way round.
 *
 * A single fleet-shaped query looked cheaper: one key, one map, one schedule.
 * But a cache entry is also a SCHEDULING UNIT, and one schedule for the fleet
 * means one cadence for the fleet. The old `sweepCadence` took the fastest
 * cadence any listed host had earned and applied it to all of them, with a
 * comment acknowledging exactly that. The cost is not theoretical: twenty
 * borrowable hosts and one ten-minute download had nineteen quiet machines read
 * roughly three hundred times each instead of roughly ten — one person's update
 * setting the transport cost of everybody else's computer, which is the precise
 * inversion of "two seconds only while the host itself reports an active
 * operation".
 *
 * The batch loop that used to bound the burst went with it, because four
 * `Promise.all`s of one host each bound nothing. That job now belongs to
 * `fleet-read-gate.ts`, which caps concurrent reads across the whole fleet.
 *
 * Host-keyed entries buy two more things the fleet map could not express:
 * per-host RETENTION (a declined read keeps that host's last observation
 * instead of vanishing from a rebuilt map) and COALESCING with the canonical
 * `host.status` query — the selected host and the local host are already being
 * read by the Overview and the landing banner, and reading them a second time
 * over a borrow was pure duplication.

 * ages past its deadline and projects the qualified `unknown`, which is the

 *
 * An errored entry is treated as absent rather than as evidence — a failed

 * builds it: `[...hostMethod(hostId, method, params), ...cacheKeyIdentity]`.
 * Both canonical `host.status` consumers pass empty params and no
 * `cacheKeyIdentity`, so the key is exactly what this reconstructs. If either
 * ever gains a `cacheKeyIdentity`, this lookup MISSES and coalescing degrades
 * silently — every coalesced host quietly reverts to a borrowed read, correct
 * in every answer it gives and paying for a round trip that was already paid.
 * A silent efficiency regression is the kind nobody reports, so: the
 * call-count test that proves coalescing is what would catch it, and it is
