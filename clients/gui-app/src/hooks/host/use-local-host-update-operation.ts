 * banner never summarizes remote hosts (experience doc, Scope), and a hook that

 *
 * Reads the SAME `host.status` query key every other consumer reads, rather than
 * opening a private one. Two surfaces reading one key is what keeps landing and
 * the local Settings row showing the same attempt (Flow C) — a second query

  //
  // Which mechanism demotes a reading is the thing to keep straight. On the
  // BORROWED leg the deadline does it: the observation is the cached value
  // itself, nothing else knows how old it is, so the projection has to compare
  // it against a real clock. On a CANONICAL leg the query knows its own health
  // — errored, paused, aged past `staleTime` with no fetch replacing it — and
  // `observationFromCanonicalRead` has already folded that verdict into the
  // deadline, stamping an unhealthy read as expired outright. So `nowMs` needs
  // only to be a finite instant at or after the observation for that verdict to
  // apply, and `dataUpdatedAt` is precisely that.
  //
  // It is also the reactive one. A render-time clock advances only when
  // something else re-renders this component, so a query that stops polling
  // would keep projecting whatever it last computed; the health signals change
  // the query's own state and therefore notify. Reaching for a clock here would
  // add impurity and subtract reliability.
  // Ticket 07 §5.2.7 — the host-down window.
  //
  // Desktop re-reads `update-attempt.json` and publishes the facts on the
  // controller status for exactly this moment: the host is unreachable, so the
  // wire observation above has gone stale, but a durable attempt is still on
  // this machine's disk and the banner can still say what it was doing.
  //
  // Precedence is NOT decided here. `preferLiveOverRecord` already encodes it
  // (a FRESH wire read wins; the record fills the window only once that read is
  // stale or absent) and it is deliberately freshness-based rather than
  // recency-based — the record is re-read every tick, so "newest wins" would
  // let it outrank a healthy live read and permanently suppress real progress.
  // Re-deriving that rule here would be a second copy of it.
  // Both inputs come from the CONTROLLER query, and that pairing is the point:
  // `observedAtMs` describes when THIS record was read, so it must be stamped
  // by the query that read it. Borrowing `statusQuery.dataUpdatedAt` here — the
  // live `host.status` leg — is wrong in exactly the situation the arm exists
  // for: in the host-down window that query has never succeeded, so its
  // `dataUpdatedAt` is `0`, and a record freshly read from local disk would be
  // reported as observed at the Unix epoch. After an older successful live
  // read it is subtler and no better: an unrelated read's time.
