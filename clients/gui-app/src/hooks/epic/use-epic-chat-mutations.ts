 * creating host is not the one this window's record stream is keyed to. See
 * `stores/epics/open-epic/pending-chat-creations.ts`.
 *
 * Wired into the shared create hooks rather than into each caller for three
 * reasons. It cannot be forgotten - a surface added later inherits it by using
 * the hook, which is how the sibling surfaces came to share one silent
 * `CHAT_PROJECTION_WAIT_MS` wait in the first place. It reads the REQUEST, so
 * the retained row can never disagree with what was actually sent (the host it
 * was dialled at, the parent, the title). And it is mutation-level rather than
 * a per-`mutate` callback, which TanStack drops when the calling component
 * unmounts - and every one of these surfaces closes itself the moment it
 * submits.
 *
 * The OWNER, by contrast, is captured at mutate time and handed in - see
 * {@link CreateChatMutationContext.ownerUserId}. Only the row's TIMING belongs
 * on success; the identity it is filed under belongs to the request, and reading
 * it back here would attribute the chat to whoever happens to be signed in when
 * the answer lands.
 *
 * On SUCCESS, deliberately, not at mutate time: until the host answers, the
 * chat exists nowhere, and a row for it would advance the initial-chat
 * handoff's projection machine (and disarm its orphan deadline) for a chat that
 * may never be created. The window this closes is the one the user actually
 * waits through - between "created" and "visible" - not the one they spend
 * watching a submit spinner.
 *
 * The id is read back from the RESPONSE: the resolver is idempotent on the
 * client-minted id and echoes it, and it is the id the opener navigates to, so
 * taking it from here keeps the retained row, the open intent and the eventual
 * record on one identity.
