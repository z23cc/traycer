 *
 * Hiding and revealing are gated differently, and deliberately so. Every
 * archive *affordance* is hidden unless support is positively known
 * (`useChatArchiveSupported`, fail-closed). But hiding rows on a host that is
 * KNOWN to lack the method would strand them: the archive visibility filter, the
 * Unarchive entry and the empty-state hint are all capability-gated, so a row
 * archived on a newer host and then seen from an older one would be invisible
 * with nothing left to bring it back. Archived records must never become
 * unreachable, so a known-absent host stops hiding.
 *
 * `null` (pre-handshake) keeps hiding rather than revealing: revealing on
 * unknown would flash archived rows on every cold start and then hide them a
 * moment later, which is worse than the toggle appearing late.
