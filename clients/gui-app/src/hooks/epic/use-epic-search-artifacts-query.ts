 * loads or scans Markdown itself.
 *
 * The query key is `[host, method, { epicId, query, fields, filters, limit }]`,
 * so a change of host, Epic, query, or composed filter mints a new key and a
 * late in-flight response for the previous scope lands in that previous key's
 * cache slot - never the current one. `keepPreviousData` is intentionally NOT
 * used: `data` for the current key is therefore only ever this exact scope's
 * result, and the consumer owns same-scope retention across keystrokes so a
 * prior Epic/host/filter result can never render.
 *
 * `epic.searchArtifacts` is an optional (non-floor) capability: an old host
 * rejects with `E_HOST_UNSUPPORTED`, surfaced here as `query.error.code` for
 * the consumer to render a degraded state without a toast.
