 * reaches for, which is exactly what the host's own reason text rules out).

 * leaves that field permanently null. Here `null` means something different:
 * the candidate's GENERATION could not be established - an unstamped feed, an
 * unparseable one, or a build reached by electron-updater's deep-validation
 * fallback rather than the one the release gate proved. Offering an
 * unknown-generation build as the remedy for a compatibility rejection restarts
 * the app straight back into the same rejection, so the answer is no.
