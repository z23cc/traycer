/**
 * Owns the `sessionImport.run` subscriptions for the whole app - ONE PER HOST.
 *
 * App-level rather than wizard-level on purpose: the user is invited to close
 * the wizard and carry on with the tour while the import runs, and a stream
 * owned by that wizard would detach the moment they did - leaving the Settings
 * entry and the reopened wizard with nothing to show but a stale snapshot.
 * Here it stays attached for the life of the window, and the store it feeds is
 * what every import surface reads.
 *
 * "One run at a time" is still the contract, but it is the HOST's contract, so
 * it holds per host: a second start for a host that is already importing is
 * refused, while another machine can start one of its own. The target travels
 * with the request (`SessionImportRunTarget`) rather than being read from this
 * component's ambient binding, so a run started from a host-scoped panel runs
 * on the host that panel is showing.
 *
 * It also asks the host, whenever the AMBIENT stream client connects, whether
 * a run is already going. A window opened while the host is still importing -
 * a reload, a second window - would otherwise show an idle wizard over a live
 * run, and its Import button would attach to that run instead of starting the
 * user's own selection. Only the ambient host is probed: a scoped host is
 * asked about by the surface that opens it, and probing every host the window
 * could reach is a fan-out nothing has asked for.
