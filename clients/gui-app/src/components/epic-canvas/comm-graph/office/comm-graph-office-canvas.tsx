/**
 * The OFFICE rendering of the communication graph: a pixel-art floor on a
 * single `<canvas>`, where every agent is a character at a desk and every A2A
 * message is an envelope flying desk to desk.
 *
 * SAME PROJECTION AS THE NODE GRAPH. This component takes the identical props:
 * the epic's full agent set, the agents that exist as of the cursor, the merged
 * as-of event array, and what the cursor row pulses. Nothing here reads a clock
 * to decide WHAT to show - only how far along an animation of it has got. So a
 * replayed floor and a live one cannot disagree, and neither can the two modes.
 *
 * THREE COORDINATE SPACES, kept apart on purpose:
 *
 * - SPRITE space - integer pixels at 1x, what the scene and the sprites speak.
 * - SCREEN space - CSS pixels inside this component's box. The camera maps
 *   sprite to screen (`screen = sprite * zoom + offset`), and labels are drawn
 *   here so text stays crisp instead of being magnified into mush.
 * - DEVICE space - screen times `devicePixelRatio`, the canvas bitmap.
 *
 * The camera lives in a ref, not in React state: it is read by the animation
 * frame and written by pointer handlers, so routing it through a render would
 * re-render the tree at 60Hz to move numbers nothing else reads.
