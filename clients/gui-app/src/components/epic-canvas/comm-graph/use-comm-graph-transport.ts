/**
 * The transport: the controls that MOVE the epic's time cursor, and the single
 * playback tick.
 *
 * ONE OWNER, always. The tick lives with the controls, so the cursor cannot
 * double-step no matter how many things are watching it. That ownership used to
 * belong to the sidebar timeline panel; the panel is gone and the on-canvas
 * transport bar inherited it wholesale.
 *
 * LIVE IS `cursor === null`, not a flag beside the cursor. Everything here that
 * looks like a mode change is really just the cursor landing on, or leaving, the
 * newest row - which is why "scrub to the end", "play to the end" and "press
 * Live" all converge on the same state instead of three that must be kept in
 * agreement.
 *
 * The store outlives this hook (it is per epic, not per tile), so unmounting the
 * graph freezes playback where it stands rather than restarting it: `playing`
 * stays true and the next mount picks the tick back up.
