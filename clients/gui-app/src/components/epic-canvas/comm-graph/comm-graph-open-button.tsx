/**
 * Opens the epic's communication graph from the Agents panel header.
 *
 * The graph used to have its own sidebar rail entry, which put a whole panel in
 * the rail for something that is one canvas. It lives here instead because the
 * Agents panel is already the list of the things the graph draws - the button is
 * "see these as a graph", next to the other controls that act on that list.
 *
 * DEDUPING BY CONSTRUCTION: `makeCommGraphTileRef` derives the tile's content id
 * from the epic, and `openTile` focuses an existing tab with that id rather than
 * minting a second one. That matters beyond tidiness - per-tile state keyed on
 * the content id (the graph's persisted viewport) would otherwise be written by
 * two tabs at once, so panning one would move the other.
