/**
 * React binding for the comm-graph per-host fan-in.
 *
 * The manager is a plain object rather than a hook-per-host because the host set
 * is data-driven (one subscription per host the epic's agents live on) and hooks
 * cannot be opened in a loop.
 *
 * It is also SHARED, not owned by this hook: the Communication panel and the
 * graph tile both call this, and both must see the same event array. The
 * registry hands back the epic's single manager and counts claims, so one
 * surface open means one subscription and both open still means one. Releasing
 * DETACHES rather than disposes, which keeps events, cursors and the per-host
 * snapshot boundaries - so reopening a surface resumes instead of re-pulling,
 * and history does not re-flash as if it had just arrived.
 *
 * THE CLAIM CARRIES THIS SURFACE'S OPENER. `useDurableStreamTransportFactory`
 * reads its dependencies through a ref that THIS component's effect refreshes,
 * so the opener goes stale the moment this component unmounts. Handing it over
 * with the claim - and taking it back on release - is what stops a retained
 * manager from redialing through a dead surface's frozen refs.
