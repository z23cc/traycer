/**
 * The `comm-graph` tile body: the per-epic communication graph CANVAS.
 *
 * Unlike every other tile, this one is NOT bound to a host on the LOCAL plane -
 * it opens one `epic.communicationGraph.subscribe` per host the epic's agents
 * live on and merges the frames, so it must never read `useTabHostId()` (its
 * own ref carries an inert placeholder host for exactly that reason).
 *
 * The CLOUD relay is a separate question and rides the tab's host. The cloud
 * feed is the same rows from any relay, so the only thing that choice decides
 * is which link carries it - and this epic tab is already riding one, which is
 * the host `useEpicSessionHostId()` names. That host is passed down to
 * `useCommGraphSnapshot`, which puts it first among the dialable relay
 * candidates and keeps the rest in ID order as failover. The per-host local
 * merge above is untouched by it.
 *
 * CANVAS PLUS TRANSPORT. The graph fills the tile and a media-player bar is
 * docked under it: play/pause, speed, and a scrubber whose track carries one
 * marker per captured event. The bar gets the FULL merged array while the canvas
 * gets the as-of-cursor prefix - the track spans everything captured, the graph
 * shows everything up to the playhead.
 *
 * The cursor itself is per-epic shared state, so closing and reopening the tile
 * does not rewind the epic's playback position.
