/**
 * Where a cross-tile jump LANDS, and who is able to say.
 *
 * Split out of `chat-tile.tsx` rather than exported from it: the tile is a
 * component module, so anything else it exports breaks fast refresh (and the
 * lint rule that guards it). These are pure decisions over a jump target, a
 * window and the rendered models, which is also what makes them testable
 * without the 100 KB tile behind them.
 *
 * The two questions are deliberately separate. {@link hostLocatorForJumpTarget}
 * decides whether to ASK the host, and answering `null` there means "this
 * client can place the row itself" - a request sent anyway is a round trip
 * whose answer is discarded. {@link coldJumpOrdinal} decides where the row IS,
 * and reads the host's answer only where its own reads have nothing.
