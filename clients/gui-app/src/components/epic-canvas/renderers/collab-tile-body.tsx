   * a drop is something the reader should be told about - without the latch it
   * would read as "not asked yet" and hold the placeholder for the full 15 s
   * tile budget.
   *
   * Both arms clear the map on a downgrade, by different routes, and the
   * routes differ in what happens NEXT - which is what this latch is really
   * reading. `@1` runs `rooms.dropAllOnViewerDowngrade()` from
   * `applyRootSnapshot` and then stays down, keeping no body state at all; the
   * lane arm runs `applyPermissionChanged` -> `requestFreshSnapshot()` ->
   * `rooms.reset(...)`, which clears the same map and then RE-SUBSCRIBES as a
   * viewer. So on `@1` the latch reports a durable drop, and on lanes it
   * reports a window that is about to be answered again.
   *
   * The derived-state idiom (`use-load-deadline.ts` uses the same shape for
   * the same reason): seeded from the CURRENT answer, so a tile that mounts
   * onto an already-refused body states it on its first frame instead of
   * flashing a placeholder, and advanced by a guarded render-phase set rather
   * than an effect, so there is no commit in which the latch disagrees with
   * what is on screen. A remount resets it, which is correct - a fresh tile
   * genuinely has no answer of its own yet.
   *
   * Do not remove the latch on the grounds that it over-reports. It does: the
   * downgrade is not the only path that empties the map - `resetInternal`
   * (replace-replica, resume-too-old, reseed, teardown) does too, and through
   * that window the latch keeps saying the host refused this document while a
   * legitimate re-subscribe is in flight. That window reads exactly the same
   * on HEAD, so the latch RETAINS a wrong state rather than introducing one,
   * and dropping it would trade the drop case for the reseed case rather than
   * fix anything. Telling the two apart needs a signal the body plane does not
   * currently send.
