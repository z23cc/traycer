 * recoverable: `worktree.getBinding` recomputes `missingWorktreePaths`
 * server-side, so restoring a deleted folder and returning to the window lifts
 * the disable without a send or reload (the on-send re-stat is otherwise the
 * only recompute trigger, which a disabled composer can never reach).
 *
 * Scoped to the visible SURFACE (pane visible AND this tab selected) via the
 * `enabled` gate so backgrounded keep-alive chats - including a non-front tab
 * stacked in the same visible pane - don't all re-stat on every window focus;
 * selecting the tab re-enables the query (with `staleTime: 0`) and refetches,
 * which doubles as the surface-activation re-check. Explicit locked copies stay
 * disabled because they have no composer send gate to recover.
