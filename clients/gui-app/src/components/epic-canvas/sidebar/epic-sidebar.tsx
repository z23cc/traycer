 * then select its root. The row-level reveal - expand ancestors, select, scroll
 * - is the body's job once it is mounted for that host + workspace
 * (`epic-sidebar-file-tree.tsx`).
 *
 * Two requests cannot be served and are dropped, leaving the panel where it
 * was rather than pointed at something that does not exist:
 * - the file's host is pinned yet the panel still resolves elsewhere - a pin
 *   is a preference, and one whose host cannot serve (dead, or since
 *   deregistered so the fleet guard cleared it) resolves to `effective`;
 * - the file's root is not among the browsable roots this host offers - a
 *   synthesized out-of-root workspace (`workspaceFileRefFromAbsoluteFilePath`)
 *   or a binding since removed.
 *
 * `setSelection` is called without a one-shot guard on purpose: it is
 * idempotent on a same-value write, and the "pinned yet unresolved" check is
 * what terminates the dead-host case - so a StrictMode re-run of the effect,
 * which re-reads the SAME pre-write closure, just repeats the write instead of
 * mistaking the stale read for a refused one.
