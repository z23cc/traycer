/**
 * The session-import act's stage: the real wizard, dressed as the same mini-app
 * window the rest of the tour previews.
 *
 * It stands in for the diorama rather than sitting under the copy, because this
 * act has no mock-up to show - the panel IS the live app reading the user's own
 * machine, and a folder list is unreadable squeezed into the copy rail. The
 * height comes from the diorama's own budget so the two windows are the same
 * object from act to act, and the flex chain below it is what gives the list a
 * bounded box to scroll inside.
 *
 * The window's title says WHICH machine, and says it with the picker: the
 * sessions listed here and the run started from here belong to one host, and
 * that host is the one thing about this window a person may want to change.
 *
 * The scan is the page's, not this stage's: it has been running since the tour
 * opened, so the list is already filled in by the time this act is reached.
