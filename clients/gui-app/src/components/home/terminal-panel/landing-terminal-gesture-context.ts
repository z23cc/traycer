 * provider is the single reader of live focus/probe/runtime state, so a
 * consumer literally has no live value in scope to accidentally use. That is
 * what makes the terminal-gesture snapshot leak-proof by construction rather
 * than by auditing each consumer.
 *
 * - While a gesture is PENDING (panel opened / `+`): draft, host,
 *   availability, and client are captured at panel-open. The provider keeps
 *   reading folder metadata from that captured draft so an open chooser tracks
 *   pin/add/remove changes without following newly focused draft or host state.
 * - While NO gesture is pending: the fields are live focus (normal non-gesture
 *   operation), with `client` the app-wide default client and `generation` 0 —
 *   nothing outside a gesture changes.
