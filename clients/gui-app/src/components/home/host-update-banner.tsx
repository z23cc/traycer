/**
 * Whether the durable attempt has something to say that outranks the two-lane

 * "a stage is ready" / "activation debt" answer is the more useful one.
 *
 * Everything concrete wins — including `unavailable`, whose whole point is to
 * stay visible rather than read as a quiet host.
 *
 * `unknown` SPLITS, and used to be rejected outright.
 *
 * A BARE unknown (`lastKnownKind === null`) still loses: we could not establish
 * anything, and an unknown must never displace a concrete local fact the
 * controller does know.
 *
 * A RETAINED ATTEMPT phase does not lose, because it is not the absence of
 * knowledge — and rejecting it made the host-down window (Ticket 07 §5.2.7)
 * unrenderable on this surface. The projection's record arm ALWAYS returns
 * `kind: "unknown"` with `lastKnownKind` set: that is the deliberate shape for
 * "an attempt exists and the host is unreachable", chosen so the view holds no
 * lifecycle gate and earns no active poll. The blanket `kind !== "unknown"`
 * test therefore suppressed 100% of record-backed views, and the landing banner
 * showed nothing at all while a local update sat half-finished behind a host
 * that was not answering. The two modules downstream of this one were already
 * built for the case — `primarySentence` has a "Last seen: …" arm and
 * `showsProgressBar` an `unknown`-with-progress arm — and neither could ever be
 * reached from here.
 *
 * Retained `idle` is different: it means the last successful read found no
 * update attempt. It remains useful last-known context in Settings, but it is
 * not an operation and must not raise the landing update banner merely because
 * startup temporarily made that quiet read stale.
 *
 * It still may not DISPLACE a concrete controller fact, which is the original
 * rule kept verbatim: a ready stage or activation debt is something the user
 * can act on now, and it outranks a phase we are only remembering.

 * Update state is not a host-action mutex (plan §4), and the user is never

 * is why there is no dismiss affordance on an active operation and no disabled
