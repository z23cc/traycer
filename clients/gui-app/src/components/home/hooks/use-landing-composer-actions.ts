// do not identify a resolved git folder. When the picker is visibly showing its
// derived "New worktree" default but branch-dependent memory is still being
// validated, `cachedDefaultWorktreeIntent` closes that transient gap at the
// submit boundary without trusting the unvalidated remembered branch.
