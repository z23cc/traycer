/**
 * Tells a user who already finished onboarding that this release can import
 * the work they started in other coding agents - once, ever, per install.
 *
 * The same shape as `LoginImportAnnouncementController`, with two
 * differences. The action opens the import wizard RIGHT HERE, as a dialog
 * under the app-wide stream binding (the active host, the one the home
 * screen's terminal lands on), rather than navigating to Settings through a
 * one-shot intent - the wizard is self-contained and needs no row to land
 * on. And the tour never consumes the id on its own finish: only mounting
 * the wizard does (`SessionImportWizard`), so a user who skipped the tour
 * before its import act still gets this toast, which is the point of it.
 *
 * The toast shows on the first launch where ALL of these hold, and showing
 * it claims the `session-import` announcement (`feature-announcements-store`)
 * so it never shows again, in this window or another:
 *
 * - the bound host can import sessions (`useSessionImportAvailable`; a host
 *   that predates the feature hides the row, so a toast leading to nothing
 *   would be worse than none);
 * - the user is signed in and has COMPLETED onboarding - a fresh user meets
 *   the feature as the tour's last act instead, which consumes the same id;
 * - the tour is not on screen (a replay from Settings), for the reason the
 *   session-import progress toast holds: a toast over the stage is noise;
 * - the window narrator does not own the frame with the app gated behind
 *   its dialog, where a toast renders dead (`pointer-events: none`) and
 *   could never be dismissed - the same predicate the app-update toast
 *   reads. Held, not dropped: the effect re-runs when the narrator releases;
 * - the app-wide stream client is live, so the dialog the action opens has a
 *   host to scan. Held, never a reason to dismiss: a reconnect is transient,
 *   and the claim is permanent.
 *
 * "Later" just dismisses - the announcement is consumed either way. A gate
 * that closes while the toast is up - the host losing the capability,
 * sign-out, the tour opening - dismisses it, since it is permanent
 * otherwise; see the effect.
