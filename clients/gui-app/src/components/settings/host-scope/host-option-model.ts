 *
 * - `view`: point a read-only surface at the host (Settings' scoped sections,
 *   the header's usage popover). A host this client cannot dial is a legal
 *   pick: the surface then says why it is empty, and picking it is how you get
 *   back to it when it returns.
 * - `bind`: make it the host this window RUNS on — where new work lands (the
 *   composer, the shell's Select host dialog). A host this client cannot dial
 *   is not a legal answer there, so its row is inert rather than a click that
 *   could only fail.
 * - `pin`: scope this surface's RPCs; never rebinds the window (git-diff
 *   panel, file tree, new-terminal picker). Undialable rows stay inert, and
 *   there is no "Active" chip — same pick legality as `bind`, different write.
 *
 * All intents draw the SAME row. Which hosts exist, what they are called and
 * whether they can be reached is one answer everywhere; only the consequence of
 * clicking differs.

 *
 * which made this the app's THIRD independent status vocabulary — after the

 * carried the word "unreachable" beside it, in the same row, because the two
 * were answering different questions in the same voice.
 *
 * Those questions are now cleanly split. **Route decides interactivity**
 * (`isHostOptionSelectable` below, which the containers use to render a row
 * inert); **status decides words**, and status means the lease-derived
 * `health.state`. A row that cannot be dialled is therefore silent about it
 * here and inert to the touch, with the full reason spoken by the scope gate
 * when a `view` pick lands on it — rather than a fourth surface inventing its
 * own word for a fact three others already describe.
 *
 * `host.settingUp` outranks the table, and that ordering is the M5 requirement:
 * a machine whose host is being installed right now is not "offline" in any
 * sense a user can act on — it is mid-setup, and it will be dialable shortly.
 * It is also a mutation-lane fact rather than a status one, which is why it
 * sits outside the table instead of inside it.
 *
 * Order of precedence, most-owning first: an INERT row says nothing at all
 * (the surface owns the explanation); `settingUp` and the lease-derived
 * status word lead next, because a host that is mid-setup or has no route
 * cannot also be meaningfully described by a surface refusal; and the
 * surface refusal speaks last, for a host that IS fine and still cannot be
 * used here.

/**
 * The row's UPDATE badge — deliberately a second, separate word from
 * {@link hostOptionStatusWord}, and this file is the wrong place to merge them.
 *
 * The status word above answers **health and route**: can this machine be
 * reached, is it mid-setup, is it removed. This answers **what its update is
 * doing**. The experience doc states the rule directly — "connectivity and
 * update state remain separate facts" — and the long note on `STATUS_WORD`
 * records what happened the last time one vocabulary tried to answer two
 * questions: a row contradicted its own health line, in the same row.
 *
 * So a host can legitimately carry both ("offline" · "update failed"), and it
 * can carry the update badge with no status word at all, which is the common
 * case: a perfectly healthy host that happens to be downloading.
 *
 * SILENT during restart/reconnect on purpose. Those are the one genuine overlap
 * — the health state already has its own `restarting` word, and the doc's
 * "an observed expected restart is not flattened into ordinary Offline" cuts
 * both ways: connectivity owns that moment, and a second word beside it would
 * be the duplication this split exists to prevent.
 *
 * IT TAKES THE PROJECTED VIEW, never a raw `host.status` response, and that is
 * what keeps it from becoming a fourth vocabulary. `describeUpdateOperation`
 * (sentences, for the banner and the Overview) and this (one or two words, for
 * a single-line row) are two renderings of the SAME `FleetUpdateView.kind`, so
 * they can differ in length but cannot disagree about what the host is doing.
 * A badge derived from the wire directly could, and would.
 *
 * Silent for `idle` and `complete` because a row is for exceptions: an
 * up-to-date host and a host that just finished both have nothing a person
 * needs to act on from a picker.
 *
 * A BARE `unknown` is silent too, and that rule is load-bearing rather than
 * tidy: a badge reading "unknown" on every pre-@1.3 remote host, indefinitely,
 * is noise that teaches people to ignore the column.
 *
 * A RETAINED phase is a different thing wearing the same `kind`, and it gets a
 * qualified word. The two cases are cleanly separable — a peer that never spoke
 * `@1.3` has nothing to retain, so `lastKnownKind` is exactly `null` for the
 * noise case and non-null only for a host we genuinely watched doing something
 * before losing it. The retained word is deliberately coarser than the live
 * one: from a picker, "which phase was it in" is not a question anyone acts on,
 * whereas "this machine was mid-update when it went quiet" is.
