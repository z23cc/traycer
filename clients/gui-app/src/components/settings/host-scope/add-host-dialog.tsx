// The commands that actually stand a host up, and nothing else.
//
// What used to be here was fiction on every line. `curl -fsSL
// traycer.ai/install | sh` pipes an HTML page into a shell — that path 308s to
// docs.traycer.ai/install, a Mintlify document, not a script — and
// `traycer.ai/install.ps1` is a 404, so the Windows tab printed a command that
// could only ever fail. Neither installer has ever existed: the CLI ships
// through npm and Homebrew (`clients/traycer-cli/README.md`).
//
// The step it then skipped is the one that does the work. `traycer login` ONLY
// authenticates — `commands/login.ts` says so in as many words, and refuses to
// provision a host as a side effect of signing in — so a person who ran the old
// three steps to the letter finished with no host, and this dialog watched for
// a machine that was never going to arrive.
//
// `host ensure` rather than `host install`: it resolves the archive packaged
// beside the CLI before the registry, so the host matches the CLI just
// installed, and it no-ops when the host is already installed, registered and
// running instead of stopping a live host to re-swap it.
//
// This is the terminal path only. A machine someone installs the desktop app on
// registers its own host at sign-in and never needs these instructions — and
// the download page it would point at is on THAT screen, not this one.

  //
  // Two rules, each carrying a false claim this dialog used to make:
  //
  // "Complete picture", not "open-time snapshot". The union is only whole
  // when both source lists have answered cleanly, and the click that opened
  // this dialog can land while one of them is failed or still in flight. A
  // snapshot taken then is missing every host the absent list would have
  // contributed, so a later successful retry made those PRE-EXISTING hosts
  // look new, and the banner named one of them as the machine that just
  // connected. The baseline therefore waits for the first clean read after
  // opening (`null` until then — the watcher keeps watching, claiming
  // nothing); the body remounts per open, so it resets with the dialog.
  //
  // `registered`, not `registered && connectable`. Requiring a dialable route
  // stranded exactly the users the plan gate applies to: a free-plan account
  // enrolling a remote machine sees it register, stay `connectable: false`
  // forever by design — and this dialog spun on "Watching for a new host…"
  // over a host that was already in the account. Registration is the
  // enrollment claim; the route is a separate fact the banner copy states
  // honestly either way.
  //
  // And a third rule the first two conspire to need: enrollment can BEAT the
  // deferred baseline. Waiting for a clean read is what stops pre-existing
  // hosts from being announced, but a fast machine can finish enrolling
  // inside that same window and land in the baseline — swallowed forever by
  // set membership. The registry's `createdAt` breaks the tie: a baseline
  // host enrolled after this dialog opened is the arrival being watched for.
