/**
 * The picker row's status word, which had NO coverage at all — and that is
 * half of why it survived P3.4's vocabulary census as a third, unnamed status
 * vocabulary.
 *
 * What it used to do was answer a ROUTE question in STATUS words: `connectable`
 * decided whether to speak, and the word was `unreachable` or `requires
 * upgrade`. The incoherence that produced is the reason this file exists: a
 * registry-only host whose health line read "Reported reachable" carried the
 * word "unreachable" in the same row, because two layers were answering
 * different questions in one voice.
 *
 * The split ruled for this pass: ROUTE decides interactivity
 * (`isHostOptionSelectable`), STATUS decides words (`hostOptionStatusWord`,
 * keyed on the lease-derived `health.state`). Both halves are pinned here, and
 * the crossing test at the bottom is the one that would have caught the
 * original defect.
