/**
 * A host's update story: what it can install, and installing it.
 *
 * Check now shells `host available --json` on the SCOPED host and the answer is
 * rendered as a version list with a per-row Install — the same list the local
 * recovery console has always shown for this computer, now available for a
 * remote host too, because `host.update.check` returns the whole manifest and
 * not just `latest`.
 *
 * It replaces a free-text version field that wrote `desiredVersion` to the
 * account registry. That control could not show what was installable, so it
 * accepted anything shaped like a version and found out later; and it was the
 * one update path that did not go through the host, which is why it needed its
 * own validation mirroring a server-side regex. Picking from what the host says
 * it has needs neither.
 *
 * What that costs, stated plainly: an OFFLINE host can no longer be pinned. The
 * pin was applied by the host's own reconciler on its next check-in and so
 * worked without a route, and this does not. The auto-update policy beside it
 * still does.
 *
 * The check is a QUERY: the list populates itself. See
 * `useHostUpdateCheckQuery` for why that overrode the "spawns a process, so ask
 * first" rule `host.doctor` still follows, and for what bounds the cost. Check
 * now is a forced refetch, which is the one thing that ignores `staleTime`.
 *
 * WHERE THE ANSWER GOES is split, and that split is the point. The card body
 * gets one line and at most two buttons — the state, Update now when there is
 * something to install, Check now — and the eleven-row version table it used to
 * hold open moved into the Advanced disclosure. A permanently-expanded list of
 * every historical version, with no way to collapse it, answered a question
 * ("which exact build do I want to pin to?") almost nobody asks, at the cost of
 * burying the one ("am I up to date?") everybody does.
 *
 * The state lives HERE rather than in either consumer because both read it: the
 * summary row needs `latest`, and the picker needs the whole manifest. This hook
 * is what keeps them from drifting into two checks with two answers.
