 * rather than because a settings pane mounted.
 *
 * What overrode that is the surface it feeds. "Pick a different version" sat
 * empty under a heading that promised a list, next to a release-candidate
 * checkbox that also did nothing, inside a disclosure you had already opened in
 * order to see versions — and the only thing that would fill it was a button in
 * a different region of the page. A control that needs a second, unrelated
 * action before it can show anything reads as broken, not as deferred.
 *
 * The cost is bounded rather than accepted wholesale. `staleTime` means
 * reopening the page inside the window reuses the answer instead of re-spawning
 * the CLI; refetch-on-focus is off, so alt-tabbing never triggers one; and the
 * poll table already schedules this method `latest`, so a burst collapses to the

 * another's label. A host too old to know the field ignores it and answers with
 * the stable list — see the request schema for why that degrades to a filter
 * that appears not to work rather than to an error.
 *
 * The derive state OMITS the key rather than sending a value for it, and both
 * halves of that matter. On the wire it is what the v1.1 request schema
 * requires: within one major there is no request-downgrade bridge, so a v1.1
 * client on a v1.0 host projects by parsing with the older schema, and a
 * literal `null` would fail that parse and turn every default catalog load
 * against an already-shipped host into `DOWNGRADE_UNSUPPORTED`. In the cache it
 * keeps the default's key distinct from explicit-exclude's, which is the whole
