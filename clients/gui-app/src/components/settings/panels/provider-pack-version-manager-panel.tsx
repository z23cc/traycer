 *
 * The panel used to open with a titled header bar — `<pack> CLI · versions`,
 * a footprint line, and the auto-download switch. All three were dropped:
 *
 * - The TITLE restated the row the popover is anchored to. It is opened from
 *   one specific CLI's version cell, so naming that CLI again is the widest,
 *   loudest element on the surface saying the one thing the user cannot have
 *   forgotten. `aria-label` on the section keeps it for screen readers, which
 *   do NOT get the anchoring for free.
 * - The FOOTPRINT was `managedVersions.totalSizeBytes` — the whole pack cell
 *   across every retained version — sitting directly above rows whose own
 *   sizes are per-version. Two numbers on different axes, one labelled "on
 *   disk" and neither summing to the other, read as an error in the smaller
 *   one. The per-version sizes stayed (they answer "what will this cost me");
 *   the total left, because a pack-wide figure belongs wherever pack-wide
 *   storage is managed, not in a version picker.
 * - The SWITCH moved to the footer. It is a durable preference, not an action
 *   on any version, so it wants the calmest position on the surface rather
 *   than the most prominent — and out of the header it stops competing with
 *   the pin banner for the same corner.
 *
 * Mutations go through the v7.0 pack RPCs; the footer's update check is a read
 * on a separate optional method, gated separately.

        the outer cap was not enough: `managedVersions.available` is every

        popover simply became a full-height wall of near-identical rows; and
        the footer only reads as a footer when the list visibly ends above it.
        Viewport-derived, per the repo's fluid-sizing rule. A row is ~41px
        (`py-1.5` around a 28px icon button, plus its 1px rule), so 10.5rem
        lands PART-WAY THROUGH the fifth: four rows read whole and the clipped
        one is the scroll affordance. A cap on a row boundary would look like

 *
 * Outside the scrolling `<ul>` rather than `position: sticky` inside it: the
 * list is a sibling that scrolls its own overflow, so this row is always

 *
 * The band used to BE the `<label>`, so the whole width toggled the switch.
 * Splitting it costs that: the label now wraps only its own text and control.
 *
 * The label's own layout is conditional, because a host without the check
 * method is not a rare state - it is every host older than this release, for as
 * long as it stays older, plus the first paint on a supported host while the
 * capability hook is still failing closed. Those hosts keep the original band
 * exactly: `w-full justify-between`, text at the left edge and switch at the
 * right. With the button present the label clusters right instead. The switch
 * is pinned to the right edge either way, so when a manifest lands and the
 * button appears, the label's TEXT moves and no control does.

 * "pick a version" was the hardest thing on the screen to read.
 *
 * That first pass moved the surplus into a hover card on the version number.
 * The card is now gone too, because hiding redundancy is not removing it —
 * three of its five lines restated the row. `Installed` was already told by
 * WHICH action the row offers (`Use` means installed, `Download` means not);
 * `pairs with this Traycer release` is the `Recommended` chip in prose; and
 * `Can't switch to it — …` became a second copy of the disabled `Use` button's
 * own tooltip the moment those buttons went icon-only. Size went with it: it
 * decides one question, "what do I delete to reclaim space", and a figure you
 * must hover each row in turn to collect is a poor way to answer it.
 *
 * Only the certification survived, as a chip, because it is the one thing here
 * that changes whether an ACTION IS REVERSIBLE — see `versionRowChip`.
 *
 * The card also cost more than its content. It made the version number a
 * focusable button with a ring, so a number read as an editable field, and its
 * content opened directly over the rows below it — a list you cannot see while
 * inspecting a member of it.

 * `<body>`, so the second press of a two-press flow has nothing to land on and
 * the state change is never announced — the confirmation step becomes a
 * mouse-only affordance. Focusing on mount is what keeps the two presses on one
 * control, and it is imperative because `jsx-a11y` forbids the `autoFocus` prop.
 *
 * The visible word can't carry the version the way the icon buttons' labels do
 * ("Delete?" has to stay short), so the accessible name restates it: in a
 * five-row list an unqualified "Delete?" names no version at all.
