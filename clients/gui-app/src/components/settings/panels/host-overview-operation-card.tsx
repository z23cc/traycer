/**
 * The selected host's update operation, on its Overview.
 *
 * Deliberately the SAME two functions the landing banner renders from —
 * `describeUpdateOperation` for the sentence and `offersForceRestart` for the
 * affordance — so the two surfaces cannot describe one attempt differently or
 * disagree about whether force is offered. This component owns layout and
 * nothing else; every decision it looks like it is making was already made in
 * the projection.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, which is the load-bearing half:
 *
 * It disables nothing outside itself. No prop reaches it that could, and it
 * renders no overlay. A busy, parked, failed or stale attempt changes what this
 * card SAYS and whether it offers **Force restart…**; Restart, Diagnostics,
 * Activate and the overflow menu are untouched and stay operable throughout.
 * The overflow Restart remains the secondary path to the same place, so a
 * person is never required to engage with this card to recover their host.
 *
 * That is a product rule with teeth: the states most likely to make someone
 * want to restart — parked on live work, or failed — are exactly the states a
 * page-wide lock would trap them in.
 *
 * IT ALSO DOES NOT READ THE LANDING BANNER'S DISMISSAL STATE, and that omission
 * is load-bearing rather than incidental. Dismissing a failed update on the home
 * screen is client-local presentation state; "the failure remains discoverable
 * in the selected-host Overview until host-side expiry or a newer attempt
 * supersedes it" (experience doc). This card IS that Overview. Wiring
 * `landingDismissedAttemptIds` in here — an easy-looking consistency fix —
 * would delete the evidence the dismissal was explicitly allowed to hide only
 * from the other surface.
 *
 * Retry and Diagnostics are likewise absent ON PURPOSE. Both already exist on
 * this page: the version rows below are how a person installs again, and the
 * Doctor card is Diagnostics. The landing banner needs its own copies because
 * it is nowhere near either. Adding a second pair here would be the layered
 * narration this codebase keeps deleting.
 *
 * The two record-derived parks (`legacy-update-facts.ts`) are the exception
 * that proves the rule, and each gets exactly one control. **Restart** on
 * activation debt is not a second Restart: it opens the SAME confirmation the
 * overflow Restart opens, and it exists because the card's own sentence
 * ("Update installed — restart host to finish") names that action and a
 * sentence that names an action three clicks away is a dead end. **Force
 * update…** on a staged wait has no counterpart anywhere else on the page -
 * the version rows install without force, and force is precisely what a
 * parked stage needs.
