/**
 * G1 — the selected-Overview lifecycle-gate matrix. This is the independent
 * cold review's finding 1 (HIGH): the Overview used to build its update
 * projection with `freshUntilMs: Infinity` / `nowMs: dataUpdatedAt` /
 * `connected: true` — three ways of asserting a retained read is current — so
 * a host that reported `downloading` and then went unreachable stayed
 * `downloading` FOREVER: `holdsLifecycleGate` never released, an open restart
 * confirmation closed itself, and the Doctor bridge's restart route stayed
 * refused, on a host whose only way back was the restart being blocked.
 *
 * The fix (`observationFromCanonicalRead`, exercised directly in
 * `canonical-status-observation.test.ts`) makes the deadline DERIVED from the
 * read's own health. This file is the integration proof at the seam the
 * review asked for: the real `HostOverviewPanel`, mounted, reading a real
 * `HostClient`.
