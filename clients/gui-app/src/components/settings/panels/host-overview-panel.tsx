 * ONE Overview, for every host.
 *
 * This page describes the SCOPED host by asking that host: `host.status` for
 * what it is running, `host.identity.get` for what it is called, and
 * `host.getInstallationInfo` for how it was installed. A machine on this desk
 * and a machine in a datacenter render the same components from the same
 * answers — that equivalence is the deliverable, not a side effect, and it is
 * what the fixture-parity test pins.
 *
 * What USED to be here was the local CLI bridge as primary source, which is why
 * a remote host got a thinner page describing it in a different dialect. The
 * bridge is gone from this page entirely — it can only ever speak for the local
 * machine, so no surface built on it can be part of a page that promises to
 * describe any host.
 *
 * TWO regions, not three. The identity card carries what this host IS, and that
 * includes the update ANSWER — is there a newer version, install it — because
 * that is a fact about the host in the same register as its version and its
 * session count. Everything that is a decision rather than an answer sits in
 * Installation, behind Advanced: the auto-update policy, the OS service, the
 * full version list. Updates used to own a titled section between the two, which
 * put a section header on a single sentence and read as a second subject.
 *
 * Every button degrades on its OWN capability. An old host can support
 * `host.status` and not `host.restart`; a current host on a box with no Traycer
 * CLI can restart but cannot run doctor or update itself. Collapsing those into
 * one page-level gate is how a capability downgrade during a fleet update turns
 * into "this page is broken".

  // This was `useHostBinding()?.hostClient`, and that was CORRECT — but only

  // subtree in `<HostRuntimeContext.Provider value={scopedBinding}>` (`:148`),
  // so the binding read here was already the scoped host's. The wrapper is the
  // load-bearing part and it is not greppable from the words its old comment
  // used: searching `HostBindingProvider|HostRuntimeProvider` finds nothing,
  // because it is only ever spelled as the context's own `.Provider`. A
  // correct mechanism that reads as absent is one a future refactor removes
  // without noticing.
  //
  // Reading `scope.client` is behaviour-equivalent in both reachable arms —
  // under `ready` it is the same client the wrapper re-provides, and under
  // `following` `use-host-scope.ts:190` makes it the ambient one — and it
  // removes the dependency: this panel now addresses the host it names whether
  // or not anything above it re-provides. That matters because of what hangs
  // off this value. Eight reads, and three of them WRITE:
  // `host.identity.set` renames a machine, `host.restart` ends its sessions,
  // and the drain-gate force ends them without waiting. The rule they owe is
  // stated once, in `host-scope-status.ts`: "a visible host name must always
  // match the client used by every read, stream and mutation beneath it."
  //
  // `host-overview-scoped-client.test.tsx` is the guard, and it works by
  // forcing exactly the divergence the wrapper would otherwise hide.

  // re-enables Update now and every version row the instant the request is
  // ACCEPTED rather than when the update finishes - and a second selection from
  // there sends another install that can retarget the one already running.
  //
  // `updating` is the only state that means "still going". `failed` is terminal
  // and deliberately leaves the controls live, because that is exactly when
  // someone needs to retry.
  // ONE projection, used by both the lifecycle gate below and the card that
  // renders it — deriving these separately is how a page ends up locked for a
  // state it is simultaneously describing as parked.
  //
  // ⚠ THE FRESHNESS HERE IS DERIVED, NOT ASSERTED, and the previous version of
  // these lines is why that is worth a paragraph. It built the observation with
  // `freshUntilMs: Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY` and `connected: true`, and read
  // `nowMs` from `dataUpdatedAt` — three ways of saying "assume this reading is
  // current" — on the theory that the page's own live-source helpers already
  // demoted a retained read. They demoted the BUSY snapshot. Nothing applied
  // them here, so the two projections read one retained response and disagreed
  // about it.
  //
  // What that cost: a host that reported `downloading` and then went
  // unreachable kept projecting `downloading` forever. `holdsLifecycleGate`
  // stayed true, an open restart confirmation closed itself, the Doctor card's
  // bridge restart stayed refused — on a host whose only way back was the
  // restart being blocked. Same class as the parked-attempt gate this page
  // already fixed: a fact consumed outside the conditions that keep it true.
  //
  // `observationFromCanonicalRead` now carries those conditions with the fact,
  // and it is the same function the landing banner and the fleet's coalesced
  // reads use, so a fourth staleness rule cannot appear here by accident.
  //
  // The parks the legacy updater leaves behind WITHOUT a marker - bytes
  // installed under a host still running the old version, a stage waiting
  // for a busy host to go idle - are derived from the install and staged
  // records beside the same status read. This is the one leg that derives
  // them: the banner keeps its desktop-status debt arm and the fleet legs
  // read no installation info. `null` until both reads have answered, which
  // the projector treats as "not observed", never as "no park".
  //
  // Two reads, one snapshot: the installation query is keyed by the running
  // version the status read reported (`useHostInstallationInfoQuery`), so a
  // record fetched under the previous version is never compared against the
  // new one - it is a different key with no data yet. And the record leg is
  // held to the SAME liveness rule the status leg is projected under
  // (`canonicalReadIsLive` - not "has not failed" alone, and not a second
  // staleness rule with its own timestamp arithmetic): a read that has
  // failed, is paused, or has aged past its own staleness keeps its last
  // payload in the cache, and a comparison built on it would carry the
  // status read's freshness while the record leg is anyone's guess - a park
  // derived from a record the host has since consumed or purged, still
  // offering Force for a stage that is gone. Such a read yields NO facts:
  // the parks it fed are withdrawn, the offers keyed on them with them,
  // and the projector falls through to whatever the status leg says. The
  // demotion is scoped to the record leg on purpose. Expiring the whole
  // observation instead would demote a live attempt the status leg is
  // reporting - progress bar, lifecycle gate, fast poll - on one failed
  // `host.getInstallationInfo` poll, which is likeliest exactly during the
  // swap; the record leg feeds only the two record-derived rows, so only
  // those go. An in-flight refetch is live under the shared rule, and a
  // request whose response never arrives ends as an error rather than as
  // an indefinitely retained payload - each attempt is bounded by the
  // transport's 30 s response timeout (`DEFAULT_HOST_RPC_FRAME_TIMEOUT_MS`
  // on the local leg, `UNARY_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT_MS` on the remote one) and
  // the query client retries once, so a silent poll withdraws after about
  // a minute. (`paused` is part of the shared rule; this app's queries run
  // with `networkMode: "always"`, so it does not arise here.) The source
  // here is the support flip alone (`installInfoDegrade`), deliberately NOT
  // `usable`: an unusable scope is demoted through the status leg already,
  // and that demotion KEEPS the record-derived park as a qualified "Last
  // seen: …" sentence with its controls withdrawn. Erasing the facts here
  // on `!usable` would drop the card outright instead (the lifecycle-gate
  // suite pins the retained sentence). The support flip still has to be
  // here, because it disables the query over a cached payload, and a
  // disabled query never ages (`isStale` is false while `enabled` is) - so

  // — for as long as the park lasted, with the restart it is waiting for being
  // the very thing it blocked.
  //
  // `holdsLifecycleGate` answers the narrower question (`execution === "active"`)

/**
 * How this host is installed and everything about it a person opens a
 * disclosure to find: the install record, and Advanced.
 *
 * The two are one section because they answer one question — how this host is
 * set up — and neither is urgent enough to sit on the card above. Updates used
 * to own a titled section of its own next to this one, which read as two
 * subjects on a page that has exactly one.
 *
 * The install record is pure host RPC, so with no route that row renders
 * NOTHING rather than a gate notice. That is deliberate and was a bug once:
 * this page already states an unreachable host exactly once — the identity
 * card's health line says so, and the danger zone's gate explains which rows it
 * costs. A second gate here printed the same "can't reach this host" notice
 * twice on one page. An absent row under a card that already says why is
 * quieter and truer than repeating the reason.
 *
 * Advanced is NOT gated the same way, which is why `usable` reaches the row
 * rather than this whole component: the auto-update policy inside it is an
 * account write that needs no route, and an unreachable host is a common moment
 * to want exactly that. Returning `null` for the section as a unit is how that
 * control would go missing in the state it is most wanted.
 *
 * `unmanaged` IS a real state rather than an error: a host run from a checkout
 * has no install record, and reporting that as "nothing is installed" put a
 * false alarm on every developer's machine.
