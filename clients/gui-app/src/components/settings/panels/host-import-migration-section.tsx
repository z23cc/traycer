/**
 * The two rows that move ONE MACHINE'S local data - an import of the sessions
 * lying on its disk, and the migration of its SQLite tasks and epics to cloud.
 *
 * They used to sit in General, which is app-wide, so both spoke for whichever
 * host the window happened to be pointed at while naming none. Here the page
 * title already names the machine, and the sidebar's host picker is how you
 * choose a different one.
 *
 * Both ride the STREAM transport, so this section is only honest beneath the
 * Overview's re-provided `StreamRuntimeContext` - which is why the binding is
 * checked against the host this page NAMES before anything renders. Under an
 * explicit pick the scoped transport takes a commit or two to resolve, and
 * until it does the ambient stream is still dialing the effective host: running
 * an import or a migration through it would move the wrong machine's data under
 * this machine's name.
 *
 * The whole group is withheld rather than emptied. An empty `SettingsGroup` is a
 * titled, bordered box with nothing in it, which reads as a page that failed to
 * load rather than one with nothing to offer.
