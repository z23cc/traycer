/**
 * ONE time cursor per epic, read by the graph canvas and driven by the
 * on-canvas transport.
 *
 * It outlived the sidebar panel that used to own it, and deliberately: keeping
 * the cursor here rather than inside the tile means closing and reopening the
 * graph does not silently rewind the epic's playback position, and any future
 * second reader of "where is the cursor" gets the same answer as the canvas.
 * Keyed by epic id.
 *
 * SESSION-ONLY, deliberately not persisted. A cursor is a reading position into
 * an event log that is itself not persisted client-side: restoring "paused at
 * 14:02:41" against a log this client has not re-pulled would point at nothing.
 * A fresh load starts live, which is also the product default.
 *
 * Playback TIMING is not here. This store holds where the cursor is, not who is
 * moving it: the on-canvas transport owns the tick (it owns the controls), so
 * `playing` is an intent any reader can observe while exactly one advances it.
