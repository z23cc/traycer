 * Schema + factory for the `comm-graph` tile (the per-epic communication

 * of trusting the stored value, so dedup is self-healing with no migration
 * step. The identity is the EPIC - one graph per epic - which is also why the
 * ref carries no host binding: the tile fans one subscription out per host the
 * epic's agents live on, so `hostId` is the inert placeholder the blank tile
 * uses and the tile body never reads a per-tab host.
