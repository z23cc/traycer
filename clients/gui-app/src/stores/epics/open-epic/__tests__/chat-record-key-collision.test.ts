/**
 * Regression pin for `recordKey`'s composite-key join
 * (`runtime/chat-record-table.ts`).
 *
 * The row map inside `createChatRecordTable` (via the shared
 * `createRecordTable`) is keyed by `recordKey(ownerUserId, chatId)`, which
 * used to join the two components on ASCII code point 31 (the "Unit
 * Separator" control character) rather than the length-prefixed
 * `sessionKeyOf` it is now. Nothing on the wire stops an id from containing
 * that separator itself (the wire schemas are bare `z.string()`), so a
 * separator join is non-injective: putting the separator INSIDE one
 * component of a pair, at a different offset than the other pair uses, still
 * concatenates to the identical character sequence even though the two pairs
 * share no piece. Under the row map's own admission logic
 * (`createRecordTable.applySnapshot`), the SECOND row then silently
 * overwrites the first's map slot before either ever reaches the published
 * slice, so the first chat disappears from the sidebar exactly as if it
 * never existed - no error, no removal frame, nothing to explain it.
 *
 * There is currently no test file for `chat-record-table.ts` at all. The
 * `record()` fixture below mirrors `chat-records-union.test.ts`'s builder of
 * the same name; `getCurrentUserId: () => null` is that same file's
 * "nobody signed in" convention, under which `isOwnedRecordVisibleToUser`
 * short-circuits to visible-to-everyone so both colliding owners can be
 * observed side by side.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: the separator is built with `String.fromCharCode`, never typed
 * as a source-level escape or pasted as a raw control byte - either of those
 * risks landing an actual control byte in this file (git then flips it to
 * binary).
