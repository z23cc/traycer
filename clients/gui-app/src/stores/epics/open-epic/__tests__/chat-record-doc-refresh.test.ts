/**
 * Regression pin for the doc-over-doc waiver in
 * `chatRowSupersedesOnSnapshot` (`runtime/chat-record-table.ts`).
 *
 * A doc-resident chat has no registry head seq, so the host reports
 * `revision: 0` on EVERY answer (`chat-record-summary.ts`, which says so).
 * The table's snapshot rule was `candidate.revision > held.revision`, and
 * `0 > 0` is false - so the first answer of the session won permanently and
 * every later read of the same live doc map was discarded. For a caller with
 * no doc replica that answer is those chats' only source, so a rename or an
 * archive performed anywhere else stayed invisible until the chat was adopted
 * into the store.
 *
 * The waiver is keyed on `docResident` and scoped to the SNAPSHOT path, and
 * the two controls below are what make it a waiver rather than a hole: it must
 * not fire between two registry-backed rows (that comparison is what stops an
 * answer already in flight from clobbering a delta-advanced row), and it must
 * not fire when only ONE side is doc-resident.
 *
 * The `record()` fixture mirrors `chat-record-key-collision.test.ts`'s, whose
 * header explains the `getCurrentUserId: () => null` convention.
