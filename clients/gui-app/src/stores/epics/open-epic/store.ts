/**
 * The zustand adapter over the epic replica runtime.
 *
 * Everything that owns state moved into `./runtime`: the root replica and its
 * projector, the artifact-body hot/cold tier, the record tables, the optimistic
 * overlay, the unsynced queue, host coverage, and the `epic.subscribe@1`
 * decoding that used to be thirty-odd callbacks writing UI state directly. What
 * is left here is the consumer side of the seam, and it is deliberately only
 * three things:
 *
 *  1. **A store shape.** `OpenEpicState`'s projected fields are named exactly as
 *     the runtime publishes them, so a delivery is a `setState` with no
 *     translation in between.
 *  2. **The two couplings the runtime may not have.** `bindingVersion` is a
 *     React remount token and stays on this side (the runtime publishes a
 *     monotonic `bindingEpoch` and knows nothing about remounts); the auth store
 *     is read here and handed in as a getter, because a runtime scheduled for a
 *     Web Worker cannot import a React store.
 *  3. **Delivery.** Subscription, equality-based re-render skipping and the
 *     batching that keeps a multi-plane frame at one `setState` are consumer
 *     concerns by contract.
 *
 * `doc` and `awareness` are the one thing on this state that is not a
 * projection: they are live `Y` objects, which cannot cross a sink and will not
 * cross a worker boundary. They are republished here, from the runtime's
 * getters, whenever the replica is REPLACED - which is what
 * `replicaGeneration()` exists to tell us.
