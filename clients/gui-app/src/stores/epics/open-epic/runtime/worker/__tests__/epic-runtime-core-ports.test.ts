/**
 * The core ports, and one property that a defect proved is worth its own file.
 *
 * `attachments.read` must SETTLE for a hash the replica does not hold. The
 * runtime's own read waits indefinitely for a hash that has not synced and
 * resolves only when its abort signal fires; across the bridge there is no
 * signal to abort, so an unguarded read holds a call slot open for the life of
 * the worker and the caller's `attachment/read` never answers.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. It SHIPPED in the first cut of this seam, which
 * called the runtime with a freshly constructed, never-aborted signal and
 * carried a comment explaining why the fresh signal was fine - the comment
 * reasoned about the response being dropped if the caller went away, and never
 * about the promise not settling at all. It was latent only because nothing
 * called `attachment/read` yet.
 *
 * So the pin below is written the way that defect would have failed it: a
 * runtime whose waiting read NEVER resolves, and an assertion that the port
 * answers anyway. A test that used a resolving fake would pass against the
 * defect.
