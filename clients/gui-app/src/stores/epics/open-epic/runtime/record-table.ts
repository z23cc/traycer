/**
 * The one poll/push reconciliation, shared by every record plane.
 *
 * The algorithm is four rules that only make sense together:
 *
 *  1. **A request-time fence.** An answer knows nothing about a write that
 *     landed after it was ISSUED, so such a write survives the answer whole -
 *     whether the answer omits the row or carries a stale copy of it. `rowSeq`
 *     stamps every accepted write with a monotonic counter; the list caller
 *     reads that counter at dispatch and hands it back with the answer as the
 *     fence, so a row ingested past it survives that answer and an answer
 *     issued after the row landed retracts it at once - a deletion missed while
 *     the stream was down is collected by the very next read, not one read
 *     later. {@link RecordTable.ingestSeq} is what a caller captures;
 *     `snapshotFence` (where the counter stood after the previous answer) is
 *     the fallback for an answer dispatched with no session to read from, and
 *     it holds an omitted row for one extra pass.
 *
 *     Both halves, deliberately. The fence was once read as an omission rule
 *     only, leaving the carried half to rule 2 alone - and rule 2 is the one a
 *     plane may WAIVE. Every plane that narrows it therefore had a window where
 *     a slow answer could overwrite a newer push with no revision left to stop
 *     it, and nothing owed to restore the row until the next poll.
 *  2. **A per-row revision guard**, in the same direction on both paths: a row
 *     that does not strictly exceed what is held is a replay, a reorder or a
 *     duplicate, and dropping it is what makes those harmless with no merge
 *     logic anywhere. NOT a timestamp comparison - host clocks skew and
 *     `updatedAt` is display metadata no ordering decision may read. Planes
 *     that have a row shape the comparison cannot judge narrow it through
 *     {@link RecordTablePlane.supersedesOnSnapshot}.
 *  3. **Absorbing retractions.** Removal is terminal for the life of the
 *     session: a retracted id is filtered out of every later answer, poll
 *     included, and no later upsert resurrects it. The list read is a SNAPSHOT
 *     of the host's store and the host applies a removal before it emits one,
 *     so a response that still carries the row was necessarily issued before
 *     the retraction - letting it through would resurrect a row seconds after
 *     its tab said it was gone.
 *  4. **One recompute**, shared by the poll and the push so the two halves of
 *     one table cannot drift in how they publish it, with the change gate on
 *     it: an answer that says the same thing as the last one writes nothing, so
 *     the 20s poll behind it costs no renders while an epic is quiet.
 *
 * Push is the trigger and the poll is the backup, so both write a table and
 * neither owns it: a host without the stream loses latency and nothing else,
 * and a delta lost to a disconnect is repaired by the next 20s list read.
 *
 * ## What is shared and what is declared
 *
 * The mechanism above is shared. Everything a plane can legitimately differ on
 * is a named member of {@link RecordTablePlane} rather than a branch in here -
 * the three that were the stated reason the two copies stayed separate through
 * the extraction (owner keying, the doc-resident revision carve-out, the
 * chat-only pending-creation registry) are each one declaration now, argued at
 * the plane that holds the fact.
 *
 * The delta UNION is deliberately not a type parameter. The two planes' frame
 * grammars are separate unions on purpose (`upsert`/`remove` versus
 * `tuiUpsert`/`tuiRemove`), and narrowing them here would put a dead branch for
 * one plane's frames in the other's path. Each plane narrows its own frame and
 * calls {@link RecordTable.applyUpsert} or {@link RecordTable.applyRemoval},
 * which is two lines and keeps the grammars where the protocol put them.
