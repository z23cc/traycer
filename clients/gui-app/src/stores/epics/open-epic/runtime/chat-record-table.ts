/**
 * Whether an incoming chat row should REPLACE the one held, on the SNAPSHOT

 *
 * ## 1. A held row whose HOME is unknown
 *
 * The chat plane's own carve-out, narrower than the terminal twin's and for
 * the opposite reason. A delta seeds `docResident: null` for a chat it has
 * never held (see `applyDelta`), and the `@1.1` answer that states the home is
 * a fresher read of the SAME registry row, so it routinely carries the same
 * revision. `n > n` is false, so without this the row would keep its unknown
 * home for the life of the session and every write affordance on it would stay
 * closed - a chat the user can see and cannot rename.
 *
 * One direction only, and only where nothing anyone stated is overwritten: the
 * waiver applies when the HELD row's home is unknown, so a stated home is never
 * replaced by a stale answer.
 *
 * ## 2. Doc over doc
 *
 * The twin's clause, which this plane needed just as much and did not have.
 * `chatRecordSummaryOfDocEntry` reports `revision: 0` on every answer, because
 * `revision` is the registry head seq and a doc entry has no seq - so "strictly
 * exceeds" rejects each refresh and freezes the row at whatever the session's
 * FIRST answer said. Under `@1.1` that answer is a no-doc-replica client's only
 * source for those chats, so the freeze hides a rename, an archive and a
 * reparent alike, until the chat is adopted into the store.
 *
 * Two doc reads are the same authority, and the later one is newer by
 * construction: `readDocResidentSummaries` re-reads the live map on every call.
 *
 * Keyed on `docResident`, and the twin's header argues against exactly that -
 * "a boolean a REGISTRY row may also carry". True THERE, where `docResident`
 * means "the doc map has a copy of me" and `origin` is the store discriminant.
 * Here it is the store discriminant: `epic-list-chat-records-resolver` stamps
 * it from `entry.home === "doc"` and its own comment calls it "provenance, not
 * path", while chat `origin` is `own`/`foreign` and answers about WRITE
 * AUTHORITY instead. So the twin's `origin === "doc"` and this plane's
 * `docResident === true` are the same question asked of two different fills,
 * and reaching for `origin` here would waive nothing while silently comparing
 * write authority.
 *
 * The stale-replica trap that motivated the twin's key cannot be reached
 * through this one: every inbox replica is stamped `docResident: false` by that
 * resolver, so both sides being `true` already means both are local rows.
 *
 * SNAPSHOT-ONLY, like the twin's, and load-bearing for both clauses. The
 * revision test is what stops an answer already in flight from clobbering a row
 * a later delta advanced (`record-table.ts` says so at the fence), and a delta
 * arriving out of order is not a fresher read of anything.
