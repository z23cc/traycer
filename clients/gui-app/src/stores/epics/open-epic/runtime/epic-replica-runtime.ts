/**
 * The composition root: the object the 3,600-line closure was cut into.
 *
 * It holds the three planes, the adapter that feeds them, and the ORDER they
 * run in. That last part is the whole point. The closure's ordering invariants
 * were recorded in prose - "read the dirty state before clearing the queue",
 * "adopt the role before re-projecting so the dead sweep's gate is up", "clear
 * the queues before publishing the new role" - and every one of them is now a
 * sequence of method calls in a named function, where a reader can see what
 * happens between two steps.
 *
 * It is deliberately thin everywhere else. It does not project, decode, or
 * evict; it owns the pieces that do. Anything richer here would recreate the
 * closure with a different indentation.
 *
 * ## The batch window, and where it is deliberately absent
 *
 * A wire frame can move more than one plane - a root snapshot settles records
 * AND control AND, on a viewer downgrade, the doc plane - and the closure wrote
 * each of those as ONE `set`. Zustand notifies every subscriber on every write
 * and each notification re-runs the selector of every mounted consumer in the
 * epic, so collapsing a multi-plane frame back to one write is a behaviour
 * requirement, not tidiness. `routeEvent` and the two multi-plane commands
 * (`requestFreshSnapshot`, `discardUnsyncedEdits`) open that window.
 *
 * Everything else does NOT, and that is equally deliberate. A doc mutation, a
 * record ingest and an overlay stamp each cost exactly one store write today,
 * and wrapping them would collapse writes the closure spent separately -
 * changing how often subscribers are woken in the other direction. The rule is
 * to match the closure's write count, not to minimise it.

   * serving. It is a rule about not TEARING DOWN a working arm, and the probe
   * respects it: probing leaves whatever is installed serving, and only a
   * probe that succeeds moves anything.
   *
   * With no arm installed there is nothing to hold and, worse, nothing that
   * would ever make the verdict decide: the client learns a method's support
   * from a subscribe completing, so a runtime that installs nothing while it
   * waits opens no subscribe, receives no answer, and stalls on that
   * connection permanently. So that case probes rather than waits - see
   * {@link EpicLaneArm.probe}.
   *
   * An installed LEGACY arm is the same stall one step later, and it is the
   * one a relay reaches every time. `RemoteStreamClient.getMethodSupport` is
   * `"unknown"` forever and its support subscription is a no-op, so on a
   * remote host the verdict is `"undecided"` for the life of the runtime: the
   * first probe fails against an old host, legacy installs, and the tab is
   * then pinned to `@1` no matter what the host becomes. Nothing short of
   * recreating the runtime moved it - not the reconnect, not the re-handshake
   * that a host upgraded in place performs, because neither produces a
   * manifest verdict on that transport. Re-probing on the same edge is what
   * makes "a host that upgrades under this tab moves onto the lanes" true on
   * the transport where the manifest cannot say so.
   *
   * The cost on a host that is genuinely legacy is one refused subscribe per
   * reconnect - the same one the first open already pays. A LOCAL legacy host
   * mostly avoids even that: its client learns `"unsupported"` from the failed
   * subscribe, so its verdict is `"legacy"` rather than `"undecided"` until a
   * reconnect wipes it.
