/**
 * Whether a chat has a record-plane home for a registry-backed mutation.
 * This does not select its destination: a foreign replica also has
 * `docResident: false`. Mutations must still address the chat's owning host.
 *
 * `epic.renameChat` / `epic.reparentChat` / `epic.setChatArchived` /
 * `epic.deleteChat` reach `ChatRegistryWriter` and through it the host's chat
 * store. A chat the store does not hold is not addressable there, and the
 * protocol says so in as many words on `chatRecordSummaryV11Schema`: "a
 * doc-resident chat is NOT addressable through the registry-backed mutations,
 * so a client that could not tell the two apart would send
 * `epic.renameChat` / `epic.reparentChat` an id naming no registry row" - the
 * worse of the two bugs it names, "because it fails on WRITE instead of on
 * render".
 *
 * ## Two facts, in this order
 *
 * T9 ruled a doc-homed row's registry mutations must be gated.
 * `root-dnd-commits.ts` documented the opposite for chats - "`epic.reparentChat`
 * has routed chats since chats-off-YJS, and the host resolves a pre-migration
 * chat through the same storage seam". Both are right, about different hosts,
 * and the fact that separates them is not on either row:
 *
 *  1. **Does this host serve a chat record plane at all?** `epic.renameChat`,
 *     `epic.reparentChat` and `epic.deleteChat` are on
 *     `RELEASED_FLOOR_METHOD_NAMES`, so they exist and work on a floor-era host
 *     that has no chat registry - and on that host every chat projects from the
 *     doc. Gating on the row's home alone would disable every chat affordance
 *     there, on a host where the RPC handles doc chats itself.
 *  2. **Only then, what did the record plane say about THIS row?** On a host
 *     that has one, the plane is the authority on where the row lives, and a
 *     row whose home is `true` (stated doc-homed) or `null` (the delta plane
 *     declined to say) is not addressable through the writer.
 *
 * ## The unaddressable outcome is DISABLED, never a doc write
 *
 * Falling back to mutating the client's `Y.Doc` would be worse than the misroute
 * it avoids: on a host with a record plane the doc is no longer the authority,
 * so record-wins snaps the edit back on the next answer and the affordance reads
 * as working while changing nothing. The hand-off's rule stands - a client must
 * not send record-plane mutations for these rows until the binding host seeds
 * the store - and "not yet" is a thing the UI can say.
