/**
 * # The client half of the windowed transcript
 *
 * The host serves a chat as a bounded snapshot, a row SKELETON streamed in
 * chunks, and RANGES of bodies fetched on demand. This module is what holds
 * that on the client: the skeleton for the whole session, whichever spans of
 * bodies are currently hydrated, and the arithmetic that decides what to
 * request and what to throw away.
 *
 * Deliberately a pure module rather than a zustand store. Every operation is a
 * `(window, frame) -> window` fold, so the interesting behaviour - identity
 * checks, eviction order, what a `reindexed` costs - is testable without a
 * renderer, and the session store holds one of these in state like any other
 * value. A store here would put React in the way of the part that needs the
 * most testing.
 *
 * ## The coordinate is `(epoch, ordinal)`, and the row id is the check
 *
 * An ordinal is an index into the projection the host published. It is stable
 * only under one epoch, and it is never trusted on its own: every hydration
 * response carries the ROW IDS it served, and those are matched against the
 * skeleton before a body is seated. That check is what makes a missed
 * invalidation cost a wasted round trip instead of bodies rendered under the
 * wrong rows - a failure that looks like a subtly shuffled chat and is silent.
 *
 * ## What this module does NOT do
 *
 * It does not fold rows. The renderer's `useRenderedMessages` does that, from
 * the records this hands it, and `row-projection-equivalence.test.tsx` is what
 * pins the two enumerations to the same list. Adding a second fold here would
 * be a third implementation of the same rules.
 */

 * it. The span holds ids rather than record objects because the same record

   *
   * ## Why the direction of a revision is not self-describing
   *
   * `indexRevision` is continuous within one host-side index, and the client
   * leans on that twice: a revision that skips means a delta was lost, and a
   * revision at or below the held one means a duplicate or a straggler
   * (`applyIndexChange`). Both readings assume the counter this client holds
   * and the counter the host is sending from are the SAME counter.
   *
   * A rebuild is exactly where they stop being the same. The counter is
   * per-VIEW - `TranscriptViewCache` starts `epoch = 0, indexRevision = 0` and
   * advances the epoch only when `rowIdsPreserveOrdinals` fails BETWEEN TWO
   * READS of one instance, so a fresh instance's first read never advances it.
   * A host restart therefore hands a chat that has never been reindexed a fresh
   * counter at the SAME epoch, which is not a rebase: the client keeps its
   * window (it resets one only for a fresh store or the windowed->legacy
   * downgrade) and the host's revision is genuinely below the one held.
   *
   * Without this flag one assignment has to serve two opposite cases, and it
   * gets one of them wrong whichever way it is written:
   *
   * - adopt the lower number, and a REORDERED older snapshot rewinds a valid
   *   index, so the host's next delta is misclassified as a gap and voids it;
   * - refuse it, and after a restart every delta the fresh host sends is at or
   *   below the held revision, so `applyIndexChange` discards each one until
   *   the host's counter climbs past a number it knows nothing about.
   *
   * ## The boundary is announced, and the host guarantees it
   *
   * `chat-session-manager.ts:34710-34717` stamps a snapshot's revision as
   * `subscriber.windowedIndex.state.kind === "held" ? state.indexRevision
   * : null`. A restart necessarily meets a FRESH subscriber, whose state is not
   * `held` - so every full-skeleton restream is announced by `null` before any
   * concrete revision, and a concrete revision only ever rides a frame to a
   * subscriber the host already believes is in sync. That makes `null` a sound
   * discriminator rather than a heuristic: armed here, the first concrete
   * revision from EITHER applier is adopted as the new baseline whatever its
   * direction, and disarms the flag.
   *
   * Armed at construction, at every rebase, and at every void, because each of
   * those is a client with no counter it can trust yet.
   *
   * ## What this does NOT defend
   *
   * A reordered snapshot is only reachable because the snapshot's byte bound is
   * unenforced: `windowedSnapshotFitsFrame` exists and no producer calls it, so
   * an oversized snapshot can cross `BULK_QOS_BODY_THRESHOLD_BYTES` and be
   * reclassified onto the bulk lane, where it can pass an interactive delta.
   * Enforcing that bound is the host's job. This guard is not belt-and-braces
   * for it: a client talks to hosts older than any such fix, so the skew
   * defense has to live here regardless.

/**
 * Insert one span, merging it with every span it touches or overlaps.
 *
 * Merging matters for more than tidiness: a reader scrolling upward produces a
 * run of abutting ranges, and left unmerged they would each keep their own
 * copy of a turn that straddles their boundary. Records are concatenated in
 * ordinal order and deduped by id, which is what preserves transcript order.
 *
 * Where two spans overlap, the INCOMING copy wins - both the row ids and the
 * record bodies (see {@link dedupePreferringIncoming}). They came from a later
 * response under the same epoch, so where the two disagree the newer one is
 * the host's current answer.
 *
 * ## One record, several spans - resolved by FRESHNESS, not by dropping a span
 *
 * A steered turn is MANY rows over ONE record set, so its slices can sit in
 * several spans that never merge: `SPAN_MERGE_MAX_BYTES` refuses to absorb a
 * touching neighbour past the cap, and a gap in the middle of a turn - `[10,14]`
 * held, `[15,17]` evicted, `[18,20]` re-fetched - leaves two that do not even
 * touch. Each carries that turn's whole record set, so the same record id lives
 * in both.
 *
 * That is only a problem if something picks between the copies by POSITION, and
 * for a while something did: {@link hydratedRecords} deduped in ordinal order,
 * so the EARLIEST span's copy won however old it was, and a turn re-served with
 * a new body kept rendering the previous one. The ledger closes that class
 * outright: the id resolves to ONE body, replaced at the seat, so position and
 * body cannot disagree.
 *
 * It must not be fixed HERE, by dropping the sharing span, and the reason is
 * worth stating because that is what this function used to do. Sharing is
 * symmetric: `[10,14]` and `[18,20]` hold each other's records, so seating
 * either one evicts the other. If both are on screen - which is precisely what
 * a steered turn looks like, an assistant slice, a steer bubble, another slice
 * - the planner re-requests whichever was just dropped, and its answer drops
 * the other. Nothing converges, no row ever finishes rendering, and the client
 * asks the host for the same two ranges for as long as the reader looks at that
 * turn. Row coverage is what makes a span worth keeping; the body it happens to
 * hold is not, because another span holding a fresher copy of that body renders
 * these rows perfectly well.
 *
 * The converse - keeping the rows and STRIPPING the shared records - is the
 * other tempting shape and is unsound for a reason this file makes easy to
 * miss: {@link evictTranscriptWindowToBudget} drops whole spans by LRU with no
 * notion of sharing, so the stripped span can outlive the one it borrowed from.
 * Its rows are then covered (the planner sees no gap) and bodyless (nothing can
 * render them), which is a silent blank with no route back.

  // re-requested. Without this, a lost `updated`-only frame survives every
  // subsequent auxiliary snapshot and the stale body is permanent.
  //

  // fill and request another resnapshot for it, which is a loop.
  //
  // And only AHEAD: a snapshot serialized before a delta this client already
  // applied is a straggler, not a gap.
  //
  // ## What `indexRevision === null` means to each counter, in one place
  //
  // Five readings hang off this one signal, and three of them move different
  // counters in different directions AT THE SAME BOUNDARY. That looks like
  // inconsistency and is not - each counter is scoped differently on the HOST -
  // so the set is stated together, because a reviewer who saw one of them alone
  // proposed "fixing" it to match the others, and that proposal was a livelock.
  //
  // 1. NOT a gap (here). `missedDeltas` requires a non-null revision: null is
  //    the host announcing a rebuild, and treating it as loss would invalidate
  //    the window the incoming chunks are about to fill.
  // 2. The REVISION is RETAINED (below). The host's counter is per-VIEW -
  //    `TranscriptViewCache` holds one per chat session and restarts it only on
  //    an epoch change - so the deltas after a rebuild carry it forward. A
  //    client that reset to 0 would read the next delta as a gap, invalidate,
  //    resnapshot, be told null again, and reset again: an unbounded loop.
  // 3. The SKELETON COVERAGE is RESET (below). Completeness is a per-STREAM
  //    fact, and the replacement stream merges into the array the previous one
  //    left - so coverage inherited from the old stream would vouch for a
  //    replacement chunk that never arrived.
  // 4. The SUMMARY GENERATION is RESET (`chat-session-store.ts`). That counter
  //    is per-SUBSCRIBER on the host, so a rebuild really can restart it at 1
  //    and collide with the value this client holds.
  // 5. The WATCHDOG DEADLINE restarts (`chat-session-store.ts`). A rebuild is a
  //    fresh stream arriving; an aux-only snapshot is not, and must not
  //    postpone a stall already being measured.
  // 6. The IN-FLIGHT RANGE SLOT is RELEASED (`chat-session-store.ts`). It names
  //    a request sent on THIS connection, so it is per-subscriber like the
  //    summary generation: a reconnect mints a fresh subscriber, its state is
  //    `none`, and the request really did die with the old connection.
  //    Releasing it on an aux-only snapshot instead re-asks for a range already
  //    being answered, once per aux frame, and the resulting requests evict the
  //    original's ledger entry at the cap - so the answer it was waiting for
  //    arrives untracked and is discarded.
  //
  // Per-view retains. Per-subscriber and per-stream reset. That is the whole
  // rule, and it is a fact about the host rather than a convention here.
  // A same-epoch snapshot BEHIND the revision this client has already applied,
  // with no rebuild between them, is describing an index the host has since
  // moved past - it can only have arrived late. Its TRANSCRIPT half is refused
  // whole: taking the revision rewinds a valid index, so the host's next delta
  // reads as a gap and voids it, and the same branch would adopt the older
  // `rowCount` and seat an older tail at the newest `servedAt`, outranking the
  // copy the client correctly holds.
  //
  // Its AUXILIARY half is still applied, by the caller, and that asymmetry is
  // the point rather than an oversight: the aux fields are last-write-wins and
  // every subsequent broadcast rewrites them, so an old one costs a frame of
  // staleness. The index has no such self-correction - that is the whole reason
  // this revision exists - so a rewind there is permanent.
  //
  // Two aux paths were checked against that claim rather than assumed to fit
  // it. `accumulatedFileChangeSummaries` is ACCUMULATED from chunks rather than
  // carried on the snapshot, and its generation reset is keyed on a `null`
  // revision, so a straggler cannot touch either. The one that does regress is
  // `clearResnapshotRequest()`, which the caller runs unconditionally on the
  // reasoning that "a fresh snapshot IS the answer an invalidated window was
  // waiting for" - untrue of a late one. It self-corrects: refusing this frame
  // leaves `invalidated` standing, so the caller's `requestPlannedHydration()`
  // asks again, and the cost is one redundant resnapshot rather than a stall.

 * Widen an `updated`'s ordinals to every row its rewritten RECORDS can reach.
 *
 * ## Why an ordinal is the wrong unit here, in both readers
 *
 * A row is served from its TURN's shared records (`rowRecordIds` hands an
 * assistant slice the whole turn's `messageIds`, and a steer row the turn's
 * records plus its own steered message). So a record rewritten under ordinal 12
 * is held by every row of that turn - and `updated` names only the rows whose
 * skeleton ENTRY moved, which is the rows whose own blocks changed. The other
 * slices of the same turn hold a stale copy of the same record while looking
 * untouched.
 *
 * {@link dropSpansForUpdatedOrdinals} already computes a record reach, but it
 * seeds that reach from the spans CONTAINING an updated ordinal - so when the
 * rewritten row is not hydrated there is no containing span, the seed set is
 * empty, and a sibling span holding the same turn's records is kept. The store's
 * in-flight ledger has the same shape one step earlier: it intersects on the
 * ordinals a request ASKED for, so a request for a sibling slice is not
 * superseded and its answer seats pre-update records that nothing refetches.
 *
 * Both readers therefore widen through here, for the reason
 * {@link bodyInvalidatingOrdinals} is shared: a second copy of "which rows does
 * this frame stale" would drift from the one deciding which spans to drop.
 *
 * ## The walk is bounded by the TURN, not by the transcript
 *
 * A turn's rows are contiguous, so this expands outward from each updated
 * ordinal while the row belongs to the same turn - never a scan of the
 * skeleton. That bound is load-bearing rather than incidental: an `updated`
 * arrives for the streaming row on every token batch, so an O(rowCount) reach
 * here would be O(history) work per token on a 20k-row chat, which is the cost
 * this whole line exists to delete.
 *
 * A steer row is crossed because it carries the turn's records too, and its row
 * id (`steer:<queueItemId>`) does not name the turn - so it cannot be matched,
 * only walked through. Crossing one costs at most a redundant refetch of rows
 * belonging to a neighbouring turn; refusing to cross one costs a stale body
 * with no gap behind it, which nothing repairs. The walk still terminates at
 * the user row that separates two turns.
 *
 * A row whose entry has not been delivered yet answers `null` and widens
 * nothing - the client has no way to know its turn, and inventing one would be
 * a guess about rows it has never seen.

 * - `appended` shifts no existing ordinal, so nothing held is invalidated.
 * - `updated` rewrites rows in place. The named rows' bodies are stale and
 *   must go - see {@link dropSpansForUpdatedOrdinals} for why the whole
 *   containing span goes with them.
 * - `reindexed` moves rows, so every ordinal after the change names a
 *   different row. The client cannot repair that from a delta and must
 *   re-request; this only marks it.
 *
 * Applied as ONE atomic frame. Within a frame the members' ordinals are
 * disjoint by construction, so order between them does not matter - but
 * splitting a frame's changes across two applications would leave a skeleton
 * whose LENGTH already equals `rowCount` and which is wrong at one entry.
 *
 * ## An epoch MISMATCH is two findings, and only one of them is a straggler
 *
 * `appended` and `updated` deliberately retain the epoch, because neither
 * renumbers an ordinal - so a frame whose epoch differs from this window's is
 * always evidence of something. Which thing depends on the DIRECTION, and
 * collapsing the two into one `!==` was a silent data-loss bug.
 *
 * An epoch BELOW this window's is a space the client has already left. Its
 * ordinals were renumbered by the very change that moved this window on, so
 * nothing in it can be applied and nothing about it is news. Dropped.
 *
 * An epoch ABOVE it is a space the client has never REACHED, which is only
 * possible if the frame that would have carried it here - the snapshot at the
 * head of that broadcast, or the `reindexed` beside it - was lost. The pump
 * keeps drop-and-continue for a flaky socket write, so that is an ordinary
 * outcome and not a broken stream. Dropping it silently is the worst available
 * answer: the host has already recorded this index as HELD by this client
 * (`reconcileWindowedIndex` updates its per-subscriber state on emit, not on
 * delivery), so it will send only deltas from here on, every one of them
 * stamped with an epoch this client discards. Nothing re-requests anything -
 * the skeleton is complete, so the completion watchdog is disarmed - and after
 * a history mutation the chat is typically IDLE, so there is no later broadcast
 * whose snapshot would repair it. The transcript then renders the superseded
 * coordinate space for the life of the connection.
 *
 * So a newer epoch is handled exactly as `reindexed` is: void the index and let
 * {@link voidedTranscriptWindow}'s adopted coordinates drive one resnapshot.
 * That is not a coincidence of implementation - a newer epoch means a
 * `reindexed` happened and this client did not see it, so it IS the reindexed
 * case, learned late.

 * stale to drop and dropping anyway starves the turn's hydration for as long
 * as it streams. See {@link isActiveTurnStreamingEcho}.
 *
 * Widened to the turn BEFORE the reach is computed: the containing-span seed
 * inside the drop is exact only when the rewritten row is hydrated, and a

 * See {@link recordSharingOrdinals}.
 *
 * ## The echo test alone, on both halves of the decision
 *
 * The store's half - whether to supersede in-flight hydration - asks exactly
 * this same question and nothing more. It once carried a second conjunct,
 * {@link holdsActiveTurnAssistantMessage}, on the reasoning that an unheld copy
 * is not being rewritten so an answer generated before those deltas must be
 * discarded. That conjunct was the starvation loop it was meant to prevent:
 * unheld is precisely the state each supersede re-created, so every echo of a
 * long turn discarded the answer for its own row and the row never hydrated.
 * The store now supersedes on the echo test alone and repairs the trailing body
 * a different way - see `chat-session-store`'s dropped-write mark, which asks
 * whether the ANSWER predates a write this client dropped rather than whether a
 * copy happens to be held at fold time.
 *
 * Holding is still what decides whether such a write was dropped at all, so the
 * scan survives in the store on that path. It is deliberately absent HERE, and
 * would be a no-op if added: {@link dropSpansForUpdatedOrdinals} drops by
 * ordinal containment, every ordinal it is given names an `assistant:` row of
 * the active turn (the entry test in {@link isActiveTurnStreamingEcho}, widened
 * along the same axis by {@link recordSharingOrdinals}), and a span covering
 * such an ordinal was served the records backing it - so "no span holds the
 * turn's assistant message" already implies "no span contains one of these
 * ordinals". Adding the scan would buy no behavioural change and would put an
 * O(records held) walk on the per-token path.

 * Drop every span containing a rewritten row - and every span holding a COPY of

 *

 * say which records belong to the row that changed: the attribution lives in
 * the host's `rowRecordIds`, which needs the row's projection source. Keeping
 * the span and dropping "the row" would mean guessing, and a wrong guess
 * leaves a stale body rendered as current.
 *
 * ## Geometry alone is not enough, and this is where that is paid for
 *
 * A rewritten row's records are held by every span its TURN reaches, and one
 * turn's slices routinely sit in several spans that never merged (see
 * {@link insertSpan}). So the span CONTAINING the changed ordinal is not the
 * only one that can hold what changed: a reader parked on an earlier slice of
 * the same turn keeps a copy in a span this ordinal never touches. Left behind,
 * it is the only copy once the containing span goes - it renders the
 * pre-update body, and its rows are covered, so the planner sees no gap and
 * nothing ever re-requests them.
 *
 * The reach is therefore computed rather than assumed: the containing spans are
 * found by ordinal, their record ids are collected, and any span holding one of
 * those ids goes with them. It terminates, because the trigger is one `updated`
 * frame rather than a seat. Every dropped span's rows become gaps the planner
 * re-requests, which is the price every other invalidation here pays.
 *
 * ## That seed is exact only while the rewritten row is HYDRATED
 *
 * Read alone it is not enough, and the gap is silent. The record ids come from
 * the spans CONTAINING an updated ordinal - so when the rewritten row has no
 * span, the seed set is empty, nothing is found to share, and a sibling slice
 * of the same turn keeps its stale copy of the very records the host rewrote.
 * That is the case this function was written to fix, arriving by the one route
 * its own geometry cannot see.
 *
 * The caller closes it by widening the ordinals to the turn first
 * ({@link recordSharingOrdinals}), which is a question about the SKELETON and
 * therefore answerable for a row this client has never hydrated. The two steps
 * compose rather than overlap: the widening finds the rows that may share, the
 * seed below finds what they actually hold.
 *
 * The cost lands where it is cheapest: an `updated` almost always names the
 * streaming row at the tail, whose span the next snapshot re-seeds inline.

/**
 * While a turn streams, the held copy of its assistant message outranks any

 *
 * A range response is generated when the host slices it, and the BULK lane can
 * deliver it long after - during which the delta stream has kept rewriting the
 * client's copy in place. Seating the served copy verbatim would regress the
 * visible body, and worse: {@link pruneSupersededLiveRecords} drops a live
 * record the moment a span carries its id, so the older served copy would
 * *replace* the fresher one rather than sit beside it. The stream is the
 * authority on the active turn's body for as long as the turn is active, so
 * the served copy is substituted with the held one at the seat.
 *
 * Only the ACTIVE turn's assistant message: every other record is not being
 * rewritten client-side, so the served copy is the freshest thing the client
 * can hold.
 *
 * TWO rules, because authority differs by record. For the ACTIVE turn the
 * stream is the authority: the held copy wins unless demonstrably BEHIND (see
 * {@link heldCopyIsBehindServed}). For a SETTLED record the host is the
 * authority and the served copy wins unless the held one is demonstrably
 * AHEAD (see {@link heldCopyIsAheadOfServed}) - which it can be, because the
 * client rewrites a settled record in place for a detached subagent's card and
 * for an image resolving, and a range sliced before that write would otherwise
 * seat the older body under the newest `servedAt`.
 *
 * "The stream is the authority" is a statement about which copy is USUALLY
 * ahead, not a guarantee that it always is, so the active-turn substitution is
 * gated on the held copy not being demonstrably BEHIND. Holding a copy is not the same as having
 * applied every delta to it: a write can be lost while the stream stays open,
 * and then this preference would pin the incomplete body in place. Nothing
 * would repair it, either - the row is hydrated, so it leaves no gap for the
 * planner to re-request.
 *
 * That gate is only as good as the copy handed to it, so the copy is the one
 * {@link hydratedRecords} renders rather than the first one found - see
 * {@link heldMessageCopy}. Comparing the served body against some OTHER held
 * copy decides the seat on a record the reader is not looking at.
 *
 * ## The arm is chosen by the CALLER, and a provisional body forfeits it
 *
 * `activeTurnId` is the only thing that selects the active arm, and the store
 * passes `null` for it deliberately when the held copy is one IT seated
 * provisionally - a body it accepted knowing the answer predated a write the
 * client dropped (see `chat-session-store`'s provisional-seat ledger). The
 * active arm's premise is that the held copy has every delta applied; for that
 * body the client itself recorded that it does not, so the premise is false and
 * the arm must not run. Under the settled arm the catch-up's copy seats unless
 * the held one is demonstrably ahead, which is the correct default for a record
 * whose incompleteness the client has already established.
 *
 * Without that, a catch-up requested precisely to repair the provisional body
 * was substituted away by the body it was sent to replace, and the row went on
 * rendering content the client knew to be short of the host with no gap left to
 * re-request it.

/**
 * Does the window hold EVERY record at or after the one carrying `messageId`?

 * `messages`/`events` as if they were the whole transcript, and on this line
 * they are a window, so a record below the edit point that is merely cold
 * reads identically to one that does not exist.
 *
 * ## Why this is a question and not a fetch
 *
 * The obvious repair - hydrate `[thisRow, rowCount)` before scanning - cannot
 * be built. A range is addressed by ORDINAL, and nothing maps a message id to
 * one: the skeleton is keyed by row id and carries no record identity
 * (`row-skeleton.ts` says so, and says why), and a span's records are a
 * DEDUPLICATED union rather than a parallel array to its `rowIds`. Even given
 * an address the request is unbounded - editing the third message of a 20k-row
 * chat asks for the whole transcript - and it would evict itself while it
 * streamed, since {@link evictTranscriptWindowToBudget} protects only the tail.
 * So the scan cannot be made to always succeed; it can only be made to know
 * when it has succeeded.
 *
 * ## The condition
 *
 * "Everything after this record is held" is a question about ORDINAL COVERAGE
 * from the record's own position onward, and the span that holds it is how that
 * position is found.
 *
 * A record can sit in more than one span - one turn's record set reaches every
 * span its rows do, and `SPAN_MERGE_MAX_BYTES` means those are not always
 * merged (see {@link insertSpan}). So the FIRST holder is the one to measure
 * from, and `spans` is kept sorted by `fromOrdinal`, which makes `find` return
 * exactly that. Measuring from a later copy would answer a weaker question -
 * whether everything after the turn's SECOND slice is held - and answer `true`
 * for a window missing the rows in between.
 *
 * A live record (accepted, not yet placed by the index) is newer than every
 * placed row by construction, so nothing in the transcript follows it except
 * other live records, which are held. It still needs the tail: the rows
 * between the last placed row and it must be there for the span to be
 * continuous with it.

 * rather than approximating it, and every refusal below is one of its own:
 *
 * - The marker is "identity unverified" rather than an id, and `seatStaleRows`
 *   returns on it before considering position, so it is never drawn at all -
 *   not even at its old ordinal. Warming a marker-only carry credits it with
 *   rows it does not put on screen.
 * - A row the FRESH tier draws is seated from that copy, and the carry loses.
 * - A NAMED row draws at its name and never falls back, so name is decided
 *   BEFORE the hole rather than beside it. Read as either-or, a row the
 *   replacement index names off-screen still reads as visible whenever its old
 *   ordinal happens to land in an unarrived hole in view.
 * - Of two carries holding one row, only the FRESHEST SERVE draws it
 *   ({@link staleRowOwners}), so the staler duplicate earns no warmth from it.
 *   Equalizing them instead would hand the tie to {@link boundedStaleSpans}'
 *   secondary key and make a squeeze's outcome turn on that, when the answer
 *   here is already known.
 *
 *   Only on the NAMED branch, and the restriction is the difference between
 *   the two branches rather than caution: a named row resolves to ONE ordinal
 *   whichever carry holds it, so every later refusal in the merger falls the
 *   same way for both and the owner's win is unconditional. An unnamed row
 *   falls back to each carry's OWN old ordinal, so an owner that cannot seat
 *   (its hole already filled) leaves a duplicate at a different ordinal that
 *   still can - and refusing that one warmth would be a missed bump, the
 *   direction this function must not err in.
 *
 * What it cannot reproduce is the pair of refusals that depend on RENDERED
 * models - an ordinal another model already took, and a row whose model the
 * renderer withheld. Those live in the row merger and nothing here can see
 * them, so this stays a slight over-estimate; the direction is deliberate,
 * since the cost of a missed bump (the on-screen carry evicted) is the failure
 * the bump exists to prevent and the cost of a spare one is a colder span

/**
 * What to fetch next, or `null` when the window is already sufficient.
 *
 * Three obligations, in priority order:
 *
 * 1. **The tail, when the LAST ROW is not hydrated.** A snapshot whose
 *    `rowCount` is positive and whose tail seated nothing means the host's tail
 *    budget could not fit even one row. The client must ask immediately and
 *    render a placeholder meanwhile - the alternative is a chat that has rows
 *    in it and displays as empty, with nothing on screen to suggest a retry.
 *
 *    Gated on {@link isTailHydrated} rather than on any gap inside the tail
 *    WINDOW, and the difference is not cosmetic: a chat whose inline tail
 *    covers its last five rows has no missing tail, and treating the fifteen
 *    rows above it as an outstanding obligation would prefetch scrollback the
 *    reader may never reach on every single snapshot. Once the tail is in,
 *    hydration is the viewport's business.
 * 2. **`required`** - rows something OTHER than the viewport is blocked on.
 *    Today that is exactly one thing: a row carrying a pending interview's
 *    question, which no scroll will ever bring into view because the card
 *    renders in the composer. A chat blocked on a question nobody can see is
 *    stuck, so this outranks scrollback the reader may never reach; it sits
 *    below the tail only because the tail is where the answer usually already
 *    is, and asking for it is the cheaper way to get there.
 * 3. **The visible span**, whichever part of it is not hydrated.
 *
 * An invalidated window returns `null`: no range can repair a void index, and
 * issuing one against a coordinate space the client has left would seat bodies
 * under the wrong rows. The caller owes a `resnapshot` instead, which is a
 * different frame and a different decision.
 *
 * @param required Ordinals that must be hydrated regardless of the viewport.
 * An ordinal outside the transcript selects itself out - see
 * {@link firstRequiredGap} - so a judgement carried across a `rowCount` change
 * cannot plan a request the host would answer with nothing.

 * the enclosing gap could spend the whole frame budget on scrollback nobody

 *

 * transcript order, which is the order the notice lists them in.
 *
 * An ordinal outside the transcript needs no guard of its own, and deliberately
 * does not have one. {@link transcriptHydrationGaps} clamps to `[0, rowCount)`

 * itself hydrated and is skipped by the same line that skips a row the window
 * already holds. A second bound here would be a restatement of that clamp -

/**
 * Evict the coldest spans until the window fits its byte budget.
 *
 * The tail is never evicted, however cold it looks. It is where a live turn
 * happens and where every snapshot re-seats content, so evicting it would
 * trade a bounded cache for an unbounded re-fetch loop - and it is the one
 * span whose absence is visible immediately.
 *
 * That exemption is only safe because a span is BOUNDED: it protects the span
 * that reaches the end, so how much it protects is decided by how large that
 * span is allowed to grow. `SPAN_MERGE_MAX_BYTES` is what keeps it a tail
 * rather than the whole transcript - without the cap, reading a long chat
 * upward from the tail coalesces every visited row into the tail span and
 * this function is left with nothing it may drop.
 *
 * Spans overlapping `visible` are never evicted either, and the budget is
 * SOFT against them - the loop stops when only protected spans remain, even
 * over budget. That is not generosity; it is the same re-fetch-loop argument
 * as the tail. The host's range read always serves the first requested row
 * whatever it costs (see `read-range.ts`), so a single visible row larger
 * than the whole budget is a legal response - evicted here as "over budget",
 * its gap is still on screen, the planner re-requests it, and the client
 * hydrates/evicts/re-fetches that row forever while it never renders once.
 * Protecting what the reader is looking at bounds the overage by one
 * viewport's spans and ends when they scroll away.
 *
 * `required` is protected for the SAME reason and would otherwise reintroduce
 * that loop in its purest form. Those rows are re-planned unconditionally -
 * they are not gated on a viewport that could scroll away - so a required span
 * evicted as coldest is re-requested on the next plan, evicted again, and the
 * client fetches one row forever. It ends the way the viewport's does: when the
 * question settles and the ordinal stops being required.
