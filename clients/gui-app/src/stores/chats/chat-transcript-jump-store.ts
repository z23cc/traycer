/**
 * Cross-tile transcript jumps: "open this chat AND scroll it to this anchor".
 *
 * `ChatScrollToBlockContext` already covers scrolling from INSIDE a mounted
 * chat tile, but a jump from another tile (the communication-graph timeline)
 * has no such context - the target tile may not even be mounted yet when the
 * jump is issued. So the request is parked here by chat id and the chat tile
 * picks it up on its next render, whether that is the current one or the first
 * one after `openTile` mounts it. Host identity is part of the key:
 * separate hosts may legitimately expose the same chat id.
 *
 * Session-only and deliberately not persisted: a jump is a navigation intent,
 * not reading position (that belongs to the global reading-position service). Requests are
 * CONSUMED - the tile clears the entry once it has acted - so a remount does
 * not replay an old jump, and a repeat jump to the same anchor still fires
 * because `requestId` advances.
