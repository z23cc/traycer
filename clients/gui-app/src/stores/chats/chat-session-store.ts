     * behind "this stream has delivered something", to stop a chat that was
     * never going to stream from reading as stalled. That gate is unsound, and
     * unsound in exactly the case the watchdog exists for: when a stream's
     * whole content fits in ONE chunk and that sole chunk is dropped, the gate
     * never closes, and a stall that loses everything is the one stall it
     * cannot see. The same hole swallows the summaries whenever the skeleton
     * arrives and the summary stream's first chunk does not.
     *
     * The premise behind it was wrong too. No chat rides the snapshot without a
     * skeleton stream: `chunkRowSkeleton` states that an EMPTY skeleton yields
     * one empty final chunk rather than zero, precisely so "this chat has no
     * rows" is distinguishable from "chunks were lost", and the host streams it
     * on every bootstrap (`reconcileWindowedIndex`'s `state.kind === "none"`).
     * A receipt gate on the client threw that distinction away again.
     *
     * So the totals answer it directly:
     *
     * - The skeleton is owed until `skeletonComplete`, which only a chunk
     *   carrying `isFinal` sets, and only once its coverage agrees.
     * - The summaries are owed while a generation is mid-ASSEMBLY, or while
     *   the published count DISAGREES with `accumulatedFileChangeCount` -
     *   self-gating, because a chat with no accumulated changes promises
     *   none, assembles nothing, and `0 !== 0` is false.
     *
     * The assembly half is not redundant with the count: the count is aux and
     * can be rewound under a generation that is still arriving, and the array
     * it would be measured against has not been published yet. See the guard
     * itself.
     *
     * Still not the same predicate as `accumulatedSummarySetComplete`, which
     * the UI's visibility and action gates share: that one asks whether the
     * PUBLISHED set is trustworthy, this one whether a delivery is still owed.
     * But they are not independent, and reading them as two clean questions
     * was the mistake - a published set cannot be trusted while its
     * replacement is mid-flight, so "a delivery is owed" is an INPUT to
     * trustworthiness. Both now open on the same clause over the same public
     * state; what stays private is the assembly's CONTENTS, which is all the
     * panel needed kept back to keep rendering the previous complete set.
     *
     * Any mismatch, not just a short prefix. A revert LOWERS the count, and
     * the snapshot path deliberately retains the previous summary array until
     * a replacement chunk starting at index 0 arrives - so if that first
     * replacement chunk is dropped, the retained array is LONGER than the
     * count it is being measured against. A `<` reads that as complete,
     * disarms the watchdog, and leaves reverted paths and stale digests in
     * the panel for the rest of the connection. Overshoot is exactly as much
     * evidence of a broken stream as shortfall.
     *
     * Neither can indict a healthy chat, because the only state that reads as
     * incomplete is one where a resnapshot genuinely repairs something:
     * `handleResnapshot` resets the subscriber's index to `none` and its
     * summary belief to `null`, so the answer to it is always a full skeleton
     * and a full summary re-stream.

     * ordinals is empty, so the answer is accepted. Slice 10 is then covered,
     * slice 12 need not be visible, and nothing refetches either.
     *

// The block id whose OWNING message a detached backgrounded-subagent event

//   - a terminal `tool_call.*` / `command.completed` → its non-empty
//     `parentBlockId` when it is a subagent CHILD; otherwise its own `blockId`
//     (a genuinely top-level background terminal - Claude backgrounds through a
//     `tool_call`, Codex through a plain `command`).
//   - any other nested event  → its `parentBlockId`.
// Null for everything else (text/reasoning/top-level tool deltas), so the
// common high-frequency path skips the owner lookup.
//
// `workflow.*` is here because it is the SAME CARD: all three write a
// `subagent` block through `makeSubAgentBlock`, addressed by `event.blockId`,
// with `started` opening and `progress`/`completed` updating-or-synthesizing -
// the accumulator's workflow arm mirrors its subagent arm case for case. A
// Workflow run is a fleet that outlives its spawning turn exactly as a
// background subagent does, so leaving it out of this table was not a
// narrower policy, it was the same hazard with no guard on it.
//
// `ownerMustExist` decides what happens when the scan finds NO owner, and it
// says what it means rather than proxying it through how the owner is named.
// The distinction it draws is whether this event OPENS its own card or updates
// one:
//
//   - `subagent.started` / `workflow.started` open it - the FIRST time.
//     `accumulateTurnContent` builds the block FROM this event, so "no message
//     owns it" is the ordinary birth of every such card, not evidence of a
//     detached one. Dropping it there means the card is never created - and
//     then its own progress and completion have no owner either, so nothing
//     about that run ever renders. A REPEAT of one is an update wearing a
//     start's clothes and is held to the update rule instead; the caller
//     supplies that, since only the session's memory knows which it is (see
//     `ChatSessionState.openedSubagentCardBlockIds`).
//   - the matching `progress` / `completed` update it. They ALSO build a card
//     when none exists (see the accumulator), which is exactly the synthesis
//     that must not happen under an unrelated turn: their card's row is
//     evictable on the windowed line, so an ownerless one means gone, not new.
//   - a `parentBlockId` owner, or a parentless BACKGROUND terminal, belongs to
//     an older row for the same reason and never falls through.
//
// A parentless FOREGROUND terminal keeps the fall-through it has always had:
// with the active turn's own row consulted (see `activeTurnOwnsBlock`) a live
// call's terminal never reaches here, so what is left is a terminal whose
// `started` was genuinely never seen, and completing it beats stranding it.

 *    The row is not an interview boundary: a provider turn can ask more than
 *    once and both interview blocks land in the same row, so a turn that
 *    answers A, asks B, then dies holds `[A answered, B streaming, disposal]`.
 *    A row-wide filter would let an exact lifecycle frame for A retire the card
 *    that is B's only explanation, while B is still waiting on the user.
 *
 * 2. CHRONOLOGY - the target's settlement must be strictly LATER than the
 *    disposal. Answering does not end the turn: the continuation streams more
 *    text and tool calls into the same row and the runtime can die after all of
 *    it, giving `[A answered, text, disposal]` where A is STILL the nearest
 *    preceding interview. There the disposal is the honest terminal for the
 *    later work, and a stale or duplicate exact-settlement frame for A - which
 *    re-runs this fold, since the effective block stays answered - must leave
 *    it alone.
 *
 * `targetSettledAt` must be the CANONICAL acceptance time - the `resolvedAt` of
 * the lifecycle frame that speaks for the block's own settlement authority,
 * which the host derives from the durable settlement envelope. It must NOT be
 * the block's `timestamp`: the reducer advances that on every contributing
 * settlement, so a losing cleanup can drag it past a disposal the answer truly
 * predates, and a stamp-based guard would then delete a truthful error.
 *
 * STRICTLY later, not "at or after": both values are millisecond readings, so
 * equality cannot order them, and retiring on a tie erases an error the user
 * needed while retaining on a tie only leaves a stale card that the host's
 * authoritative row clears on the next snapshot.
 *
 * One known degradation, deliberately accepted: a LEGACY/partial lifecycle
 * tuple carries no `settlementId`, so the caller cannot confirm it speaks for
 * this block's authority and retains. The host has still retired the block
 * durably, so the next snapshot corrects it.
 *
 * The host owns the same predicate over the same array
 * (`withRuntimeDisposalRetiredForInterview` in `chat-session-manager.ts`); this
