/**
 * Regression coverage for the "release-packaging-relocatable-plist" ticket:
 * a real `bun run package:dir` run (the documented, RELEASE.md-sanctioned
 * local-packaging entry point: `build:app` + all three prepack checks +
 * `electron-builder --dir --publish never`), production-stamped via the real
 * `set-deploy-target.cjs` exactly the way `.github/workflows/
 * release-desktop.yml` (internal repo) drives a release build against THIS
 * package.json, with no internal script involved. Unlike
 * `inject-host-launch-agent.test.ts` (which drives the exported hook
 * functions directly against a scaffolded fixture), this test proves the
 * hook is actually WIRED into the real package.json `build.afterPack` config
 * and fires during a genuine electron-builder pack.
 *
 * `--dir` (via `package:dir`, no dmg/zip/notarization) plus
 * `CSC_IDENTITY_AUTO_DISCOVERY=false` mean this never needs real Developer ID
 * certs and produces a plain ad-hoc-signed `.app` - "ad-hoc signing is fine
 * and expected locally" per the ticket. Slow (a real electron-builder pack)
 * and darwin-only (shells out to the real `codesign`/`plutil`, mirroring
 * what the hook itself does), so it's gated the same way
 * `install-desktop.test.mjs`'s own real-build suite is in the internal repo.
 *
 * Safety: every path this test touches - the staged fake CLI binary under
 * `resources/cli/darwin-<arch>/` (gitignored - see `.gitignore`) and the
 * packaged output under `release/` (also gitignored) - lives inside this
 * workspace only. It never touches `/Applications`, a real running Traycer
 * host, or calls `launchctl`. `src/config.ts` is stamped to `"production"`
 * for the duration of the pack and unconditionally restored to `"dev"` in a
 * `finally`, exactly mirroring the real release workflow's own
 * stamp/build/restore sequence - never left mutated even if the build
 * throws.
 *
 * Why this lives in `__integration_tests__`, not `__tests__`, and runs via
 * `bun run test:packaging` (see `vitest.config.packaging.ts`) instead of the
 * default `bun run test`: `src/config.ts` is a real file shared by the whole
 * workspace, and several unrelated suites (`config-dev-backend-urls.test.ts`,
 * `sign-in-url.test.ts`, `deep-link.test.ts`, ...) import the real `../config`
 * module and assert on its dev-slot values. Vitest's default `vitest run`
 * runs test files concurrently across a worker pool; with this test in that
 * same pool, its `beforeAll` stamping `src/config.ts` to `"production"`
 * raced with those other files' imports mid-run and produced spurious
 * failures unrelated to anything this ticket changed. Being production
 * -stamped for the ~10s a real pack takes is unavoidable - the whole point
 * is exercising the actual `package.json` build config with no internal
 * script involved - so instead this file (and thus its stamp/restore
 * window) is excluded from the default suite's `include` glob and only
 * ever runs alone, one file at a time, never racing another suite's import
 * of `../config`.
