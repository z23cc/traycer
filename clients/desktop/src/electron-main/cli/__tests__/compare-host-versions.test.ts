/**
 * PARITY WITH THE CLIENT-SHARED COMPARATOR.
 *
 * The desktop app updater's release selector orders `desktop-v*` candidates
 * with THIS comparator, while the host update surfaces order the same kinds of
 * version strings with `@traycer-clients/shared`'s. Two comparators deciding
 * "which build is newer" for one product is a drift risk, and the one that
 * would hurt is silent: an RC-line follower and a Settings row disagreeing
 * about whether `2.0.0` outranks `2.0.0-rc.2`.
 *
 * These pin agreement over the domain the selector actually sees - versions
 * that survived `projectDesktopRelease`'s strict `X.Y.Z[-rc.N]` tag grammar -
 * and state the one place outside that domain where the two deliberately
 * differ. If a bump or refactor makes them disagree inside it, this fails
 * before a release does.
