/**
 * Launch-time CLI reconciliation (Core Flow 2, "newest-wins"):
 *
 *   - If a Desktop-owned manifest CLI (`source: "desktop"`) is **older** than
 *     the bundled CLI, silently upgrade it: copy bundled → stable per-user
 *     path and rewrite the manifest. If the live binary is locked (typical
 *     on Windows), surface a `pendingUpgrade` instead of erroring.
 *
 *   - If the Desktop-owned slot binary is present but cannot report its
 *     version (failed probe: corrupt file, ENOEXEC, hang), never let the
 *     manifest's recorded version stand in for it - route through the same
 *     upgrade path and re-stage the bundled CLI over it.
 *
 *   - If a **package-manager**-owned CLI (homebrew/npm/winget/scoop/apt/rpm) is
 *     older than the bundled CLI, **do not** overwrite it. Return a
 *     reconciliation outcome with platform/source-specific upgrade
 *     instructions so the UI can surface the right hint.
 *
 *   - If the installed manifest/PATH CLI is **newer** than (or equal to)
 *     the bundled CLI, trust it silently for the session. A PATH CLI is
 *     only ever trusted after a successful `--version` probe: a PATH name
 *     that cannot answer is not a Traycer CLI (oss #872: the name squatted
 *     by a desktop-app launcher) and routes to bundled staging instead.
 *
 *   - If no installed CLI exists, leave staging to the first-launch
 *     setup flow (it already calls `installBundledCli`).
 *
 *   - If the manifest is malformed but a binary is reachable on PATH,
 *     fall back to the PATH binary. If neither exists, the function
 *     returns `kind: "none"`.
 *
 * The reconciliation must run **before** host-dependent setup or
 * Settings actions pick which CLI to invoke - `discoverCli()` is
 * deterministic so as long as the manifest is up-to-date when those
 * code paths run, the right CLI is chosen.

/**
 * Launch-time gate around `reconcileCli`. The dev slot's CLI lifecycle is
 * owned by the `make dev-desktop` orchestrator: it stages the dev wrapper at
 * `~/.traycer/cli/dev/bin/traycer`, which the desktop resolves via the
 * bundled-CLI path (see `resolveBundledCliPath`). The desktop's
 * reconcile/upgrade machinery (version probes, pending-upgrade staging,
 * package-manager hints) only applies to shipped builds, so it is skipped on
 * the dev slot - there is nothing for it to reconcile that the orchestrator
 * has not already set up. Shipped builds (staging/production) reconcile
 * unchanged. With the env-scoped CLI paths this is a lifecycle-ownership
 * boundary, no longer a guard against touching the prod tree.
 *
 * The gate is intentionally a thin wrapper rather than a branch inside
 * `reconcileCli` so the per-branch reconciler stays pure and so the
 * "skip on the dev slot" rule is unit-testable without an Electron process.
