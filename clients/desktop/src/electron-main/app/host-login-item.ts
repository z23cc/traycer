// macOS Login Items / Background Activity attribution for the host.

// Only `SMAppService` (callable from inside the .app bundle) produces a
// polished "Traycer" + icon row attributed to the app. So the desktop owns
// this one piece: it registers the in-bundle LaunchAgent plist via
// SMAppService, which both attributes the Login Items row to the app and
// loads + starts the agent. The host's install + lifecycle (and all
// launchd interaction) remain CLI-owned; the desktop installs the host
// bytes via `traycer host ensure --no-service-register`, then registers
// the login item here.
//
// This runs POST sign-in (auth-first boot), not at launch.

// The CLI-owned label for this environment (`ai.traycer.host[.env]`) - the
// label raw `launchctl` installs (and every pre-label-split registration)
// live under. The desktop never registers this label: it only cleans it up
// (legacy plist removal, bootout, old-serviceName unregister) inside the
// register cycle.

// (`<cli-label>.agent`). Split from the CLI label because BTM matches
// SMAppService registrations to legacy `~/Library/LaunchAgents` records by
// label, and such a record survives file deletion and bootout - see
// `smAppServiceAgentLabelId`'s doc for the full mechanism and the lockstep
// sites. Matches the in-bundle plist written by `desktop-install-cloud.js`

 * registration the host had always run under, the reinstalled app parked on
 * `not-found`, and every boot retry failed "no host is running to restart"
 * until a person ran `host service install` by hand. That command is what
 * the takeover runs, so the desktop can run it itself.
 *
 * `not-registered` is deliberately NOT in that set, although
 * `HostController.isCliTakeoverRecoverableStatus` admits it after a cycle
 * RAN: a cycle that ends `not-registered` has already booted the old agent
 * out, so leaving it there strands the machine, and `not-registered` is the
 * one status the register poll treats as potentially transient (cold-BTM
 * commit lag). A park booted nothing out, and a fresh read cannot say which
 * of the guard's three inputs refused - so only the two statuses that are
 * terminal for the life of the process admit the takeover.
 *
 * Four refusals, all read HERE after the park, never from the snapshot the
 * guard refused on, and every unreadable answer refuses:
 *
 *   - `primary-manageable`: the primary status is one SMAppService can still
 *     act on; the park was about something else.
 *   - `legacy-registered`: the legacy label reads `enabled` or
 *     `requires-approval` - a BTM record under the very label the raw plist
 *     would use, which is the collision the park exists to avoid. Honest
 *     limit: on an ad-hoc build BOTH labels read `not-found` whatever BTM
 *     holds, so this is a bound, not a proof; the residual (a BTM record from
 *     an older signed build under the CLI label, unloaded) is the accepted
 *     edge `installService` documents on its loaded-state probe, and the
 *     `register-failed` path already takes the takeover with no legacy check
 *     at all.
 *   - `manifest-unreadable`: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/<cli-label>.plist` could
 *     not be probed - the same input the entry guard refuses on.
 *   - `job-running` / `job-indeterminate`: launchd reports a live process
 *     (a positive `pid`, or `state = running`) under either label, or could
 *     not be asked. This is the down-host proof the callers'
 *     `prePid === null` is NOT: that is a structural read of `pid.json`, and
 *     a host in its first seconds after a `KeepAlive` respawn (or one whose
 *     metadata tore) has none - while the takeover's install boots a loaded
 *     CLI label out with no cooperative claim, and the CLI's own takeover
 *     treats missing metadata as a reason to boot the job out underneath a
 *     host it could not ask. A job that is loaded but has no process is
 *     fine: the CLI unloads it under its lock and re-registers it, which is
 *     the start this exists to perform. This read is a snapshot, not a
 *     lock: a job that starts between it and the CLI taking its contender
 *     lock is caught THERE - `takeoverDesktopRegistration` asks a live
 *     CLI-label process to stand down before its reload, refuses one that
 *     has no endpoint to ask yet, and unloads an idle one itself so launchd
 *     cannot start it under the install.

 * Register the in-bundle LaunchAgent as a login item via SMAppService,

 *
 * Once the cycle is committed (both guards passed), it runs:
 *
 *   1. rm `~/Library/LaunchAgents/<cli-label>.plist` (legacy CLI manifest)
 *   2. `launchctl bootout gui/<uid>/<cli-label>` (legacy/CLI job)

 *   4. `launchctl bootout gui/<uid>/<agent-label>` (LWCR flush, macOS 26+)
 *   5. SMAppService unregister → register of the agent plist
 *   6. poll status until settled; clear the pending-revision marker on
 *      `enabled`
 *
 * Steps 1–3 exist to prevent a competing host at login (an intact legacy
 * registration would `RunAtLoad` the old CLI's host alongside the new
 * agent) and to drop the old app-scoped record on healthy machines - NOT
 * to make registration succeed. They are best-effort; step 5 does not
 * depend on any of them. They are also deliberately coupled to the
 * committed cycle: a deferred (`deferred-busy` / `removed-by-user`) cycle
 * runs none of them, so a busy host paused mid-update keeps its legacy
 * *job* loaded until a cycle actually proceeds.
 *
 * That coupling no longer extends to the manifest FILE:
 * `retireCompetingCliRegistrationAtLaunch` deletes it on every launch with
 * no busy check. Deliberate - an orphaned loaded job keeps running on
 * launchd's in-memory definition, so the only thing lost is its auto-restart
 * after a crash, and that is precisely the competing host we want gone.
 *
 * The agent-label bootout (step 4) is the load-bearing LWCR step on macOS
 * 26+; the SMAppService unregister → register pair is kept for
 * defense-in-depth on older macOS where the bootout would be a no-op.
 *
 * SMAppService's BTM database caches a Lightweight Code Requirement
 * (LWCR) derived from the agent helper's CDHash at first registration.
 * When `make install-desktop-{staging,production}` replaces the .app
 * on disk, the helper's ad-hoc CDHash changes (ad-hoc signatures are
 * content-derived). On macOS ≤ 25, `SMAppService.unregister`
 * (`setLoginItemSettings({openAtLogin: false})`) drops the BTM entry
 * and the subsequent register installs a fresh LWCR. On macOS 26.5 (and
 * presumably 26+ generally) that path no longer flushes BTM — the
 * entry persists with the *old* CDHash, marked `needs LWCR update | has
 * LWCR` in `launchctl print gui/<uid>/<label>`. launchd then SIGKILLs
 * every spawn inside dyld init with `last exit code = 78: EX_CONFIG`
 * and a `Launch Constraint Violation` crash report. The symptom user-
 * side is empty `~/.traycer/host/<env>/host.log`, the 60s host-
 * ensure readiness wait timing out, and "pid metadata not yet
 * published" in the renderer.
 *
 * `launchctl bootout gui/<uid>/<label>` is the lever that *does* drop
 * the BTM entry on 26+: after bootout, `launchctl print` returns
 * `Could not find service`, and a fresh `SMAppService.register` then
 * installs an LWCR that matches the rebuilt binary's CDHash. Running
 * bootout before the SMAppService cycle is therefore the actual fix;
 * the SMAppService unregister we used to lean on is now belt-and-
 * suspenders for older macOS.
 *
 * Both Electron API calls are caught at this seam - `setLoginItemSettings`
 * can throw on the Objective-C bridge for malformed plists, missing
 * helper sub-app, or unsupported-platform paths. We turn any throw into
 * a `not-registered` return so the caller routes through Doctor with
 * a stable error rather than a raw `TypeError` / `NSError` message.
 *
 * After the register call we poll the status briefly: SMAppService
 * returns from `register` before BTM has committed the entry; a
 * synchronous status read can transiently say `not-registered` for
 * <100ms on cold-BTM (first-install) machines.

 *      (pre-1.1.7 installs) - an intact file with an `[enabled]` BTM legacy
 *      record would `RunAtLoad` the old CLI's host alongside the agent.
 *   2. Bootout the legacy/CLI job under `<cli-label>` so a currently-loaded
 *      one stops running against the label we just orphaned.
 *   3. Unregister the old serviceName (`<cli-label>.plist`) - drops the old
 *      app-scoped BTM record on machines that were SMAppService-registered
 *      under the shared label before the split. Resolves against the inert
 *      copy of the old plist the bundle keeps shipping; on machines whose
 *      only old-label record is the untouchable dangling LEGACY record this
 *      is a harmless no-op.
 *
 * Every step is best-effort (warn + continue): the agent-label register
 * does not depend on any of them, and a failed cleanup leaves the machine
 * no worse than before the cycle ran.

/**
 * Remove a `~/Library/LaunchAgents/<cli-label>.plist` that would start a
 * SECOND host beside this app's SMAppService agent at the next login.
 *
 * Why this exists separately from `retireLegacyLabelRegistrations`, which
 * does strictly more: that runs ONLY inside a committed register cycle, and
 * the routine "open the app, host is already healthy" path never runs one.
 * A machine that acquired a dual registration during the v1.1.7 window
 * therefore keeps it indefinitely - updating to v1.1.8 does not clear it,
 * because a desktop auto-update swaps bytes without a register cycle and
 * the CLI now refuses to touch the plist rather than removing it. Both jobs
 * are `RunAtLoad`, so every login starts two hosts against one data dir;
 * they start simultaneously, which is precisely the case the CLI
 * supervisor's incumbent probe cannot see (no `pid.json` exists yet).
 *
 * Two deliberate narrowings versus the register cycle:
 *
 *   1. Gated on SMAppService reporting `enabled`. Under `requires-approval`
 *      the user has disabled the login item and launchd will not spawn the
 *      agent; removing the CLI plist there would take away the machine's
 *      only auto-starting host. `not-registered` / `not-found` /
 *      `not-supported` fail into the same no-op. Same availability bias as
 *      `findLiveIncumbentHost` in the CLI: never leave a machine with no
 *      host to prevent a duplicate.
 *
 *      GAP CLOSED (formerly accepted): `enabled` proves the agent is
 *      REGISTERED and enabled, not that launchd can actually spawn it. An
 *      agent wedged by a stale BTM Lightweight Code Requirement (the LWCR
 *      / `EX_CONFIG` failure documented on `registerHostLoginItem` above)
 *      also reads `enabled` while every spawn is SIGKILLed inside dyld
 *      init - and on such a machine the CLI registration may be the only
 *      one that works (including one the user just installed with
 *      `service install --takeover`). The "real spawn observation this
 *      code has no access to" now exists: the agent's own `launchctl
 *      print` classified through the shared wedge predicate
 *      (`probeAgentWedgeForRetirement`). Positive wedge markers - or an
 *      unanswerable probe - skip the retirement: wrongly keeping a
 *      duplicate costs one more login of dual-host (which Layer 0 makes
 *      data-safe), wrongly deleting costs the machine its only working
 *      host.
 *   2. Removes the manifest but does NOT bootout the running job. Boot-out
 *      would kill a host that may be serving this session's tabs right now
 *      - and at launch we have no idea whether the competing host or the
 *      agent is the one `pid.json` currently names. Deleting the manifest
 *      is the durable half: the duplicate cannot return at the next login,
 *      and the machine converges to one host without anything being ripped
 *      away mid-session. The residual is that a machine already running two
 *      hosts keeps running two until the next login. The CLI's
 *      `retireCompetingRegistration` DOES bootout, because it only runs
 *      inside an explicit `host install` the user asked for.
 *
 * Best-effort and idempotent; safe to call on every launch. Serialized
 * through the same registration lock as the register cycle so the two can
 * never interleave on the CLI label.
