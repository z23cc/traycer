// sub-lock, so the two processes can never silently drift apart on what
// counts as "the lock is free." Path-based (no `Environment` dependency):
// callers resolve their own environment-scoped lock path and pass it in.
//
// Mechanism: open the lock file with O_CREAT | O_EXCL (Node `wx` flag). On
// EEXIST, parse the existing file's pid; if the pid is positively gone the
// holder crashed and the lock is broken. The poll loop is small and the
// lock file lives in the user's home / app-support dir so contention is
// naturally limited.

// `AcquireLockOutcome`/`WithLockOutcome` instead, so each side's thin

 * cannot be verified, holds the arbitration and no contender will break the
 * stale lock behind it (`acquireBreakLock` answers busy and the contender
 * falls back to its bounded wait).
 *
 * `free` covers the absent file, a crashed breaker's file (dead or recycled
 * pid) and an empty one: `tryRecoverCrashedBreakLock` unlinks those once
 * past {@link BREAK_LOCK_AGE_GRACE_MS}, which a contender polling inside its
 * wait reaches on its own. `held` names the breaker when there is one. A file
 * dated in the future is `held` with no live breaker: it is not recoverable
