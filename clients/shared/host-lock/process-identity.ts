/**
 * Electron-main checks an advertised endpoint first. Once the handshake has
 * established positive liveness, identity only rules out a positively
 * demonstrated recycled-PID impostor; a failed OS probe is deliberately
 * inconclusive rather than evidence the healthy endpoint is down.
 *
 * `publishedStartIdentity` is `pid.json`'s `processStartIdentity` - the
 * kernel's own record of when the publishing process was created (see
 * `@traycer/protocol/host/lifecycle`'s `process-start-identity`). It is
 * compared byte-for-byte against the same value read now.
 *
 * ### What this used to do, and why it had to stop
 *
 * The previous test was a *causality* one: derive the process's start time as
 * `Date.now() - <elapsed since start>` and call it a recycled pid if that
 * landed more than 1.25s after `pid.json`'s publication timestamp. The
 * derivation reads the elapsed term from the boot clock and the anchor from
 * the realtime clock, so a `CLOCK_REALTIME` step between publication and this
 * read shifts the result by the whole step. Past 1.25s of shift the verdict
 * became `"mismatch"` - permanently, since every later read re-derived the
 * same shifted value - for a completely healthy process.
 *
 * traycerai/traycer#740 is what that costs. On WSL2, whose realtime clock is
 * resynchronised when the VM resumes from an idle pause, one such verdict
 * both told `isPublishedHostEndpointReachable` that a host answering in 8ms
 * was unreachable AND told the recovery governor's liveness gate that a
 * running process was dead - manufacturing an outage and disabling the guard
 * against acting on it, in a single value. The user's session was torn down
 * every few minutes until the respawn budget ran out and the app wedged on
 * "Traycer Host became unavailable".
 *
 * So there is no wall-clock fallback here on purpose. When the clock-immune
 * comparison cannot be made - a `pid.json` written by a host that predates
 * the field, or a platform probe that failed - the honest answer is
 * `"indeterminate"`, and every caller already routes that to its fail-open
 * branch. Losing recycled-pid detection for those records is a real cost, but
 * it is bounded (the user is asked to click Retry) where the false positive
 * is not (a healthy host is killed on a loop). New hosts publish the field
 * and get exact detection back.

// comparison itself has nothing to go on (a failed read, or no recorded
// identity) does the result fall back to "indeterminate".
//
// ### Why this compares stamps and not timestamps
//
// It used to take two epoch-millisecond start times and call them the same
// process within a symmetric 5s tolerance. Both were derived as
// `Date.now() - <elapsed since start>` - an elapsed term measured from boot,
// anchored to the realtime clock - and taken at two different moments. A
// `CLOCK_REALTIME` step larger than the tolerance between recording a token
// and verifying it therefore moved one operand and not the other, and the
// function answered "alive-different": positive, confident evidence that a
// live lock holder was a recycled pid. Callers act on exactly that by
// BREAKING the holder's lock, so on a machine whose clock steps - WSL2
// resuming a paused VM, a laptop waking, NTP correcting - two processes
// could end up inside the same critical section.
//
// This is the same defect as traycerai/traycer#740, which reached users
// through `getPublishedProcessIdentityVerdict`. The tolerance was never the
// problem and no value for it would have helped; the operands were.
// `ProcessStartIdentity` is recorded once by the kernel and only read back,
// so the comparison is exact equality and no clock can reach it.
