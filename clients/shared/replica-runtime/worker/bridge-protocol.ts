/**
 * The main-thread <-> runtime-worker message contract.
 *
 * Two shapes of traffic, and the split is an architectural fact rather than a
 * convenience:
 *
 *   - EVENTS travel in both directions and are fire-and-forget. Everything the
 *     worker produces for the UI is an event (projections, patches, logs),
 *     because a projection is a broadcast to whoever is listening and has no
 *     reply.
 *   - CALLS travel ONE way: the main thread asks the worker for what the
 *     replica knows. The worker asks the main thread for NOTHING, and that is
 *     DERIVED rather than assumed - it was assumed once, and wrongly.
 *
 *     Two worker->main calls lived here (`main/auth-revalidate`,
 *     `main/mint-credential`) because the plan was to move the SOCKET into the
 *     worker, which would have needed the app-wide single-flights the socket
 *     depends on. That plan was withdrawn: `buildHostStreamClient`'s remote
 *     branch reaches a module-scoped process-wide `RemoteSession` cache, so a
 *     worker importing it opens a second Noise session and relay socket per
 *     (hostId, userId) - and mobile is remote-only. The transport stays on
 *     main and the worker holds an `IStreamClient` PROXY over this bridge
 *     instead; see `stream-proxy-protocol.ts`.
 *
 *     Every member of that proxy is an event or a push, because every
 *     worker->main member of `IStreamClient` / `IStreamSession` returns `void`
 *     and the two returning a session return one the worker builds itself. The
 *     count is therefore zero, and machinery for a direction with no members is
 *     deleted rather than kept behind a pin asserting nothing travels on it.
 *     A worker->main CALL must not reappear without a paragraph here naming the
 *     synchronous main-thread-only fact that forced it.
 *
 * Payloads are structured-clone values only. Nothing here may carry a live
 * `Y.Doc`, an `Awareness`, a function, or a class instance - a `DataCloneError`
 * from `postMessage` surfaces at the boundary with no indication of which field
 * caused it.

/**
 * Bumped when a frame's shape changes incompatibly.
 *
 * Both sides ship in one bundle graph, so a mismatch is not a fleet problem -
 * it is a stale chunk surviving a dev HMR reload, which otherwise presents as
 * a worker that connects and then quietly ignores half its traffic. The
 * handshake turns that into one loud error at startup.
 *
 * **13** adds `apply-confirmed-chat-mutation`; an older worker cannot dispatch
 * the renderer-local archive/delete reconciliation command.
 *
 * **12** since `main/lane-unary` and the first production emitter of
 * `stream/manifest`. The two moved together because they are the lane arm's
 * two halves: the manifest is what lets a worker SELECT the lanes at all, and
 * the unary is what the lane arm needs once selected. A v11 worker never
 * receives a manifest, so it reads every method's support as `"unknown"`
 * forever and holds the fail-closed legacy arm for its whole life - an epic
 * that works, on the arm this cutover exists to retire, with no symptom. A v11
 * MAIN answers `unserved` to the call, so a v12 worker's workspace context
 * never arrives and its migration retry never reaches a host. Both are the
 * quiet-degradation failure this constant exists to make loud.
 *
 * **11** since the body plane's RETURN leg: `body/doc-in`,
 * `body/awareness-out`, `body/awareness-in` and `body/release`. A v10 worker
 * pushes no collaborator edits and no presence, so an epic looks alive and
 * edits one-way - the failure a version check exists to make loud - and it
 * has no handler for a forward-only release, so every `@1` body it ever
 * materializes is held for the life of the session on both sides.
 *
 * **10** since `attachment/await` / `attachment/cancel`: the WAITING half of
 * the attachment class, which `attachment/read` alone could not serve without
 * turning "still replicating" into "missing". One bump for the pair - they
 * land together, so a peer is either before both or after both.
 *
 * **9** since `root/encode` / `root/apply`: the root-state transfer the merge
 * sites depend on. A v8 worker answers `unserved`, so a session replacement
 * silently transfers nothing - the failure the `applied` boolean exists to
 * make impossible.
 *
 * **8** since `command/enqueue`: the write-command queue's enqueue crossed as a
 * call, because the queue mints the id and refuses from its own state. A v7
 * worker answers `unserved`, so every write is refused at the call site - loud
 * rather than silent, but every write.
 *
 * **7** since `runtime/command`: the fifteen fire-and-forget members the store
 * used to call directly on the runtime. A v6 worker hits its own `assertNever`
 * on the first one, which is loud - but only because the event union is
 * exhaustively switched; the version is what stops a v6 worker being adopted
 * at all.
 *
 * **6** since `mutation/apply`: the main thread asks the replica to perform
 * metadata mutations and to stamp its optimistic overlay. A v5 worker has no
 * handler for the call and answers `unserved`, so every rename, delete and
 * reparent silently does nothing while the UI shows its optimistic result -
 * the worst arm of this failure mode, because it looks like it worked.
 *
 * **5** since the accounting vocabulary: the worker reports its bytes rather
 * than reaching a process accountant it would have COPIED, so a v4 worker
 * pushes no settlements and a v4 main answers no demote request. Both sides
 * would run - and the books would silently hold nothing for that runtime,
 * which is the failure mode that has no symptom until a plane never evicts.
 *
 * **4** since the body payloads carry `docGuid`: a v3 worker materializes
 * without an identity and a v3 demote cannot be refused on one, so the two
 * sides disagree about when a body may be replaced.
 *
 * **3** was the composition root: `current-user` was added and the
 * worker->main call direction returned with one member. A v2 worker hits its
 * own `assertNever` on the first `current-user` push.
 *
 * **2** was the stream proxy. v1's vocabulary was gone, not extended:
 * the bearer and endpoint pushes, the bearer probe call and the `main-call` /
 * `main-result` frames were removed and the `stream/*` events added. A v1
 * worker and a v2 spawner share no traffic worth the name.
 *
 * This number did NOT move when that vocabulary was replaced, and the comment
 * above was already describing the exact failure it then permitted: both sides
 * read `1`, the handshake matched, the stale worker answered `ready` and was
 * adopted, and it ignored every stream frame it was sent - which is
 * indistinguishable from a runtime that is merely slow. A version constant
 * that does not move with its contract is not a check; it is a comment that
 * looks like one.

   *
   * The paragraph this member owes, and it starts with why they are here at
   * all. Both are on `hostRpcRegistry`, not the stream registry: they are
   * unaries, so they ride the main-thread messenger, and the messenger reaches
   * the same process-wide `RemoteSession` cache as the socket. That is the

   * these are not a new kind of coupling, they are two more members of the one
   * class this bridge already carries.
   *
   * Why they cannot be pushes. The workspace context IS a payload the runtime
   * consumes (it is `earlyMeta`, which the legacy arm receives as a frame and
   * projects into `snapshotMeta`), so there is nothing to push. The retry is a
   * COMMAND whose whole reason for becoming a unary was that the monolith's
   * fire-and-forget client frame made "the host refused" and "the host never
   * received it" the same observation - so spelling it as a bridge EVENT here
   * would reintroduce, one layer over, the exact defect the protocol change
   * removed.
   *
   * ONE kind carrying both rather than two kinds, because they are one class
   * and move as one: `lane-unaries.ts` defines them together, the registry
   * degrades them together (`degrade: { kind: "unsupported" }`, both off the
   * released floor), and both are unreachable on the legacy arm. A caller that
   * has one has the other.
   *
   * Neither is on the hot path: the context is read at open and on named
   * refresh triggers, and the retry is a user gesture on a failed migration.
   * Neither is reached while frames are flowing, which is what keeps this from
   * re-creating the stall the relocation removes.

/**
 * Realm-independent `Uint8Array` test.
 *
 * `instanceof` is the obvious spelling and it is wrong here, because it asks
 * "was this built by MY realm's constructor" rather than "is this a byte
 * array". Bytes reaching this parser were built by structured clone, and a
 * structured clone deserializes into the RECEIVING realm - which is this one
 * in a browser, but is not in every environment that runs this code. Under
 * jsdom the clone comes from Node's realm while the module's `Uint8Array`
 * binding is jsdom's, so `instanceof` answers false for a perfectly good
 * payload and the parser rejects a reply it should have accepted.
 *
 * That is not merely a testing inconvenience: it is a validator whose verdict
 * depends on which realm minted the object, and the first thing it did was
 * push a suite into asserting on frame metadata instead of on the bytes the
 * caller receives. `ArrayBuffer.isView` reads an internal slot and the
 * `toStringTag` is the type's own, so both cross realms intact - and together
 * they still reject a `DataView` or an `Int16Array`, which is the whole point
 * of checking.
