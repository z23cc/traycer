  // Keep the well-known CLI slot pointing at the anchored binary, BEFORE
  // commander parses anything.
  //
  // The slot is what the host daemon shells and what registered services
  // launch, but the only code that re-stages it sits on service REGISTRATION
  // paths. A channel whose upgrade replaces the executable without
  // re-registering - winget, whose portable manifest cannot run a
  // post-install hook at all - would otherwise leave both running the
  // previous version indefinitely, up to a protocol-incompatible one, no
  // matter how much the user exercises the CLI in between.
  //
  // Here rather than in a `preAction` hook, which was the earlier placement
  // and had a hole exactly where this cohort steps: commander resolves
  // `--version` and `--help` during option handling and exits before any
  // hook runs, and `traycer --version` is precisely what someone runs to
  // confirm a winget upgrade landed. The real executable would report the
  // new version while the slot stayed on the old one - and a command
  // launched FROM that stale slot cannot repair it, because with no manifest
  // the slot is its own authority. Running before `parseAsync` covers every
  // invocation, informational exits included.
  //
  // Affordable there because the refresh self-guards: an interpreter run
  // (dev, tests) returns before touching the filesystem, and an unchanged
  // install costs a small manifest read and two stats. Awaited rather than
  // fired and forgotten - a copy racing process exit would be interrupted on
  // every short command and never complete.
  // Straight-line awaits inside ONE async function, not a floating promise
  // chain: the sequencing IS the point (nothing may parse until the slot is
  // settled), and a `void ...then()` spelling of the same order has already
  // been misread once as parsing racing the refresh. Not top-level await,
  // although the source is ESM - the npm distribution bundles this entry to
  // CJS, where TLA cannot compile. So exactly one `void` remains, on the
  // whole entry: the `catch` below is terminal for every expected failure,
  // and `installProcessFailureHandlers` above is the backstop for anything
  // that escapes it.
