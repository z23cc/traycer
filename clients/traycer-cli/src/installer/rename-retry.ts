// (which force-kills the host tree) can still observe EBUSY/EPERM for a
// brief window even though the host is already dead. Retry a few times with
// a short backoff (~2.5s total). POSIX renames don't raise these codes, so
// this is a no-op there.
//
// Standalone (not defined in `install.ts`) so it has no dependents besides
// what it needs itself - `install.ts`, `stage-reconcile.ts`, `aside-dirs.ts`,
// and `download-stage.ts` all reuse this same Windows-safe rename for their
// own swap/restore/invalidate paths without creating an import cycle between
// them.

// A caller-tuned retry: `delaysMs` sets both the attempt count and the
// backoff, and `onRetry` (when non-null) runs after each retryable failure
// before the backoff sleep - the install swap uses it to re-kill lingering
// host processes whose handles are exactly what made the rename fail.
//
// `verifyBeforeAttempt` is deliberately evaluated by this primitive, rather
// than only by its callers. A retry is a new irreversible rename attempt and
// a retry hook can itself kill a process; checking only once before entering
// this loop would let a lost update-attempt capability authorize both later
// operations. Verification failures are never caught here.
//
// `maxTotalMs` is a wall-clock ceiling across ALL attempts, hooks, and
// backoff sleeps. The schedule alone does not bound the retry when the
// hook is slow - the Windows re-kill is a bounded scan-then-kill loop
// whose every PowerShell step carries a 30s ceiling, so one pass on a
// degraded machine can stretch a ~24s schedule into minutes while the
// caller holds the cli-lock with the service stopped. Once the ceiling is
// exceeded, the next retryable failure is
// thrown as final. Null bounds the retry by the schedule alone.
