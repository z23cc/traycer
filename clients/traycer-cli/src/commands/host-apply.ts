// `traycer host apply [--force] [--no-service]` - promotes the single-slot
// staged tree over the current install (Host Update Layer Redesign Tech
// Plan, "New/changed commands" > `host apply`). The entire reconcile ->
// read-records -> no-op/busy-check -> commit flow runs inside ONE
// `cli-lock` acquisition - see `installer/apply.ts`'s `applyHost`, which
// assumes it is already running under the lock, same contract as
// `installHost`.
//
// `--no-service` is internal/hidden (the desktop-owned packaged-macOS
// path, which drives its own locked SMAppService activation cycle after a
// non-disruptive bytes-only apply) - see the registration site in
// `index.ts`.
//
// SUCCESS CONTRACT, and why it deliberately differs from `host update`'s.
// Exit 0 here means THE SWAP COMMITTED - not that the host came back. A
// post-swap service start that fails is reported as `postSwapError` on an
// `applied` outcome, per `applyHost`'s explicit no-rollback contract, and
// `runningActivated` says whether a start was REQUESTED and accepted - not
// that anything is serving. See `activationOf`.
//
// That is not an accident to be aligned away. `host apply` is the low-level
// primitive whose committed/not-committed answer callers need SEPARATELY from
// convergence: Desktop's `applyStagedCliOwned` reads `postSwapError` off this
// exit-0 envelope and renders "installed, not converged" with a Doctor
// pointer, and it reserves the thrown-error path for applies that did not
// commit at all (where its recovery is "retry with force"). Exiting non-zero
// on a failed post-swap start would route a committed swap into that
// wrong-recovery branch.
//
// `host update` is the composite and answers the other question - it stages,
// applies, then health-probes, and FAILS (`E_HOST_UPDATE_HEALTH_CHECK_FAILED`)
// when the updated host does not come back. A caller that wants "the host is
// running the new version or tell me it isn't" wants `host update`; a caller
// that wants "commit these bytes and report what happened" wants this. Both
// commands state that in their help; `activation` below makes the distinction
// readable from the payload without re-deriving it from three fields - and is
// carefully NOT called "converged", because nothing here probes health.

/**
 * What happened to the SERVICE after the bytes committed - deliberately not

 * means the post-swap start/restart returned without throwing, and on macOS
 * `launchctl kickstart` returns as soon as launchd ACCEPTS the request - a job
 * that is registered but unspawnable answers success (the same "requested, not
 * started" caveat `service/index.ts` records for `agentStartRequested`). So
 * the strongest honest value here is "requested".
 *
 *   - `requested`      the post-swap start/restart was accepted. NOT proof the
 *                      host is serving; `traycer host update` health-probes,
 *                      and `traycer host status` answers it directly.
 *   - `failed`         the post-swap start/restart REQUEST threw
 *                      (`postSwapError`). Bytes are committed; whether
 *                      anything is still serving was not checked.
 *   - `not-attempted`  committed, but no start ran - `--no-service` (no
 *                      lifecycle at all), or a `postSwapAction` of "none",
 *                      which is what a non-bootstrap caller gets against an
 *                      unregistered service. NOT the Desktop-managed macOS
 *                      case: that branch kickstarts the agent label and
 *                      reports "start".
 *   - `null`           nothing was committed (`no-op`,
 *                      `stage-fingerprint-mismatch`,
 *                      `stage-version-mismatch`), so there is no
 *                      activation to report. NOT `failed`: those outcomes
 *                      never touch or probe the running host, and reporting a
 *                      failure for a healthy, already-current install would be
 *                      a claim this command never made.
