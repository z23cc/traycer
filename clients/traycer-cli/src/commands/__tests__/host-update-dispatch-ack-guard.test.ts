// Ticket 07 §5.2.8 — `buildHostUpdateCommand` calls `installDispatchAckStamper`
// as its FIRST action, before `downloadAndStageHost` writes anything. A run
// dispatched with a nonce this build cannot honour has already lost the
// correlation its caller is waiting on, and discovering that after staging
// bytes would mean doing destructive work for a dispatch that can only ever
// report indeterminate.
//
// This suite uses the REAL `../host/update-dispatch-ack` module (unmocked) —
// the claim under test is that an illegal nonce is refused by the actual
// validator before any destructive work runs, not merely that some mock was
// called. `host-update-dispatch-ack-wiring.test.ts` covers the wiring itself
// (that the nonce reaches the installer at all) with the module mocked.

// SAFETY: `buildHostUpdateCommand` now probes the REAL `~/.traycer/host/
// pid.json` for activation debt, and an unmocked read on a developer machine
// could classify the developer's live host as debt and restart it. Every test
// that invokes the command mocks the probe to "no running host".
