// `traycer cli upgrade` - self-upgrade the installed CLI binary.

// Decision matrix based on the CLI install manifest's `source`:
//
//   desktop / manual                → self-replace the binary in place.
//                                     If the live binary is locked
//                                     (Windows supervisor running, or
//                                     POSIX EBUSY), stage the new
//                                     binary and record pendingUpgrade
//                                     so the next controlled service
//                                     restart finalises the swap.
//   homebrew / winget / scoop /
//   apt / rpm                       → refuse self-upgrade and tell the
//                                     user to run the package
//                                     manager's upgrade command. Do
//                                     NOT touch the package-manager-
//                                     owned binary.
//
// Pending-upgrade semantics:
//
//   * The first attempt always tries an atomic rename (verify → write
//     to a sibling temp path → rename over the live binary).
//   * If the rename fails with EBUSY/EPERM/EACCES (typical when a
//     long-running supervisor has the binary open on Windows), we
//     keep the staged binary, record it in `pendingUpgrade`, and exit
//     0 with a "staged" status. Future CLI invocations (or the
//     supervisor restart) finalise the swap.
//   * On success we update the manifest's top-level version/path and
//     clear any prior pendingUpgrade.
//
// Target-version contract (audit CLI-013):
//
//   The rolling feed publishes ONE build's platform assets. There is no
//   per-version asset map, so no historical version is resolvable. The
//   version stamped into the manifest is therefore always the feed's
//   own `version` - the one its `platforms` map describes - and
//   `--target` is a GUARD, not a selector: it asserts which build the
//   caller expected and fails when the feed no longer serves it. That
//   keeps installed bytes and recorded version inseparable; the
//   previous behaviour downloaded the feed's build and recorded the
//   caller's arbitrary string.
