// `traycer host restart` - kicks the OS service so the supervisor
// re-spawns the host. The supervisor itself re-reads the install
// record at spawn time, so this is also how a freshly-installed
// host gets picked up after `host install` if the service was
// already running on the previous binary.
//
// Restart is also the moment we get to finalise a pending CLI upgrade.
// `traycer cli upgrade` stages the new binary and records
// `pendingUpgrade` when the live binary is locked (Windows: the
// supervisor process holds the CLI .exe open; cross-platform:
// read-only install dir). Between `stop` and `start` the supervisor's
// lock is released, so we attempt the staged-binary swap in that
// window and then start the service back on the new binary.
//
// On Windows the *current CLI process* (the one running this command)
// is itself executing from the live `.exe`, so even after the
// supervisor releases its lock, renameSync still fails with EBUSY.
// For that case we hand off to a detached helper that waits for the
// CLI process to exit and then completes the swap + service start
// asynchronously. See upgrade/finalize-helper.ts.
//
// A failed in-process finalize is non-fatal: the service is still
// started, the pending state remains visible in Doctor, and the next
// restart (or the helper) retries the swap.
//
// `cli-lock` coverage (Host Update Layer Redesign Tech Plan, "Lifecycle
// lock coverage"): a terminal restart must not enter another actor's
// apply/install/activation critical section and stop/kill the process
// it just started - the whole marker-reconcile -> stop -> finalize ->
// start sequence runs inside ONE lock acquisition.
//
// `--if-idle` (hidden, internal - the CLI-owned activation mode): after
// acquiring the lock, probe `assertHostNotBusy` before the disruptive
// step; busy -> `E_HOST_BUSY`, the lock releases with nothing touched.
// The only step between the probe and `controller.stop()` is
// `reconcilePostFinalizeMarker`'s local file read - not the network or
// long-running work the TOCTOU-floor principle guards against - so the
// probe runs immediately before this call rather than being threaded
// into `restartWithPendingCliUpgradeFinalize` itself. Plain `host
// restart` (no `--if-idle`) skips the probe entirely, keeping today's
// unconditional semantics for explicit user restarts.
// `--force` (user-facing): skip the cooperative shutdown claim and kill the
// host process before relaunching. The user explicitly accepted losing
// running sessions and in-flight agent work; see `host stop --force` for the
// mechanics. Mutually exclusive with `--if-idle` - one flag widens the busy
// gate, the other removes it, and a command carrying both has no coherent
// intent.
// `--defer-if-parked` (hidden, internal - the Desktop force-restart path):
// when the canonical recovery classification says `stop-only`, do NOT stop the
// service; refuse and report, leaving a running host running.
//
// ## Why this is a flag on THIS command rather than a check by the caller
//
// The classification and the action it authorizes must happen under ONE
// acquisition of the contender lock. Desktop previously read the attempt record
// itself, decided the record was not an active continuation, and only then
// shelled this command - a snapshot, not a condition on the restart. A new
// contender can park `preparing/activate` in the window between that read and
// this command taking the lock, so the caller's "safe to restart" verdict was
// already stale when it was acted on: the CLI would then classify the NEW
// record as `stop-only`, stop the service, and report `restarted:false`,
// leaving the host down with a continuation on disk. That is the stranding the
// Desktop check existed to prevent, produced by the check itself.
//
// Deciding here closes the window by construction, because
// `contenderContext.recoveryAction` is computed from the record under the same
// lock that guards the stop/restart below. It also removes the second copy of
// the policy: which phases are recoverable is `recoveryActionFor`'s call in
// shared, and no caller re-derives it.
