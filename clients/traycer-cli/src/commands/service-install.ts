// `traycer host service install [--no-linger] [--takeover]` - register the
// OS service for the current environment. `--no-linger` skips `loginctl
// enable-linger` on Linux. `--takeover` (macOS) moves host management from
// the Traycer Desktop app to the CLI: the Desktop-managed host is stopped
// cooperatively, its agent registration booted out, and the CLI-owned
// service registered in its place.
//
// This command STARTS a host (systemd `enable --now`, launchd bootstrap), so
// it owns the same sign-in pre-flight and post-start credential provisioning
// as `host install` - it is the deferred half of the documented
// `host install --no-service-register` split flow, whose bytes-only first
// half deliberately skipped both on the promise that "the actor that later
// starts the service owns the sign-in question". That actor is this command.
