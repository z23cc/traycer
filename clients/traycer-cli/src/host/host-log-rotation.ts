/**
 * Single-generation rotation for `host.log`.
 *
 * `host.log` is append-only from every writer - the supervisor's bootstrap
 * markers, the host's stdio fd handed to `spawn`, and the host's own file
 * logger - so nothing ever truncates it. That leaves two problems, and this
 * module is the one answer to both:
 *
 *   - **Unbounded growth.** Nothing caps the file. A long-lived host retrying a
 *     failing provider can grow it without limit (`harness-runtime.ts` says as
 *     much in its own comment).
 *   - **Forensics destroyed on purge.** `traycer host uninstall --all` deletes
 *     the log outright, and `make dev-desktop` runs exactly that on every Ctrl-C
 *     teardown - so the session you actually want to investigate is routinely
 *     gone by the time you look.
 *
 * Rotating to a single `host.log.1` sibling addresses both without either
 * failure mode of the alternatives: it bounds the file (unlike pure appending)
 * and it preserves one previous generation (unlike deleting/truncating). One
 * generation is the whole design - this is a forensic trail across ONE restart,
 * not an archive.
 *
 * ## The cap is checked AT START, not continuously - and that is a real limit
 *
 * Be precise about what {@link MAX_HOST_LOG_BYTES} buys: it bounds the log
 * **across restarts**, not *within* a single host's lifetime. A host that runs
 * for weeks can still grow `host.log` past the cap, and nothing here stops it.
 *
 * This is not laziness about the cost of a `stat` on the append path - it is a
 * correctness constraint. The supervisor hands the running host a long-lived
 * append **fd** for its stdout/stderr (`spawn(stdio:[ignore, fd, fd])`), while
 * the host's own logger writes to the same file BY PATH (`appendFileSync`). An
 * fd follows the inode across a `rename`; a path does not. So an in-process
 * rotation while the host is live would send the logger's lines to the new
 * `host.log` while the very same process's stdout kept flowing into
 * `host.log.1` - one session torn across two files, which is strictly worse for
 * forensics than a large file. Rotating before that fd is ever opened has no
 * such hazard.
 *
 * Making the cap a true within-lifetime bound therefore requires the supervisor
 * to stop sharing one file between the child's stdio fd and the path-writers
 * (give the host's stdio its own sink, or have the host reopen stdio after it
 * rotates). That is a larger change than this module, and deliberately out of
 * its scope.
 *
 * Best-effort by contract: rotation is a diagnostics nicety and must never block
 * a host start or an uninstall, so every entry point swallows its errors.
