 * Throws `E_HOST_BUSY` when a LIVE host has work in progress, or when a
 * live host's idle/busy state can't be determined (fail-safe). Returns (so
 * the caller proceeds) when there is no live host to protect: no pid.json, or
 * a stale pid.json whose process has exited. Callers skip this under `--force`.
 *
 * Liveness is judged from pid.json + the process being alive, NOT the OS
 * service-controller status. This is deliberate: in the macOS host-owned
 * SMAppService path the CLI does not own the service registration, so its
 * service status reports "not-installed" even while the host is live. Keying
 * the busy check off that status would skip the probe and let a reinstall tear
 * down in-progress work.
