// authoritative; we only route the verdict to the right per-vector action.

// Client-upgrade hint per install vector. The `desktop` and `manual` rows are
// phrased for protocol-incompatibility recovery (distinct from `cli upgrade`'s
// self-upgrade refusal: desktop defers to the app's electron-updater, manual
// covers npm-global + standalone re-download). The package-manager rows

 * reading two booleans. Here the host has already answered that question and
 * gone further: it named the generation it needs and what this CLI declared.
 * Restating "this CLI is out of date" beside that would be the vaguer of two
 * answers, printed second.
 *
 * The observed version is the HOST's normalized view (`null` when it could not
 * read one), not `resolveCliVersion`. Printing what the host actually saw is
 * what makes a mis-stamped build diagnosable from one line of output.
 *
 * WHAT IT NO LONGER PRINTS is a remedy VERSION. The host used to name the
 * earliest build carrying the required epoch, and that string had to serve the
 * desktop app and the CLI at once - so it was only ever right for one of them
 * at a time, and wrong for every CLI installed through a package manager whose
 * version numbering we do not control. Admission is epoch-only and so is this
 * sentence: it states the generation gap and leaves the artifact to the
 * caller's install vector, which {@link resolveCompatRecovery} above already
 * knows how to name.
 *
 * Returns `null` when this was not an epoch rejection, which includes every
 * host that predates the gate.

 *    bounded at one hop by the upgraded binary itself - it knows its own
 *    `CURRENT_CLIENT_COMPATIBILITY_EPOCH` and states plainly whether it clears
