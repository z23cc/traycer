// and the restore the live path is EMPTY - and an empty path is exactly
// what a create-if-absent (the pre-lock claim, the no-transfer publish)
// lands into. Without a lock that interleaving loses a LIVE writer's
// record: A's stale clear takes B's marker out, C's claim lands in the
// gap, A's restore finds the path taken and drops B's record (a restore
// that loses to a newer marker does not retain it) while B - already past
// its own reassert - runs unannounced under C's marker, which no CAS of
// B's can later repair or clear. The retries under the install lock
// repair a collision during a writer's OWN reassert, not another writer's
// cleanup after it has started.
//
// So every conditional write - create, replace, delete - runs under one
// short cross-process lock beside the marker (the shared lock protocol
// through the CLI facade `withCliScopedFileLock`: O_EXCL create, holder
// identity, a dead holder broken by liveness). The
// hold is a handful of renames; the wait is bounded, and a holder that
// outlives it (a live process stuck mid-swap) makes the primitive answer
// `failed` - nothing of the intended write landed, warned by name - the
// same answer as any other marker I/O failure. This lock is NOT the
// install/contender lock: it is never held across a download or a wait,
// and it nests inside the install lock (the reassert) without ordering
// hazards because nothing takes the install lock while holding it. It is
// NOT re-entrant: a nested take from the same process polls its own live
// pid for the whole wait and answers `failed` - the locked bodies call the
// `...Locked` inner functions, never the outer primitives. The host daemon
// only reads the marker; every writer OF THIS VERSION takes the lock. A
// CLI from before the lock (a terminal `traycer` beside Desktop's bundled
// one, or mid self-upgrade) still writes into the window, which is why
// the swap's "empty path is not proof" arms below stay.
//
// Cost: the acquisition is one O_EXCL create, a metadata write and an
// unlink - no spawn: the holder's start time and stamp are the cached
// own-process reads. A wedged lock (a holder alive past the wait, or one

 *    atomically. From here on nothing a writer does can touch what we hold,
 *    and anything it lands is a NEWER marker at the live path.
 * 2. Inspect the scratch. If it is NOT what we expected, it is a live marker a
 *    writer landed between the caller's read and step 1, and it goes back:
 *    `link(scratch → marker)` restores it atomically and fails with EEXIST if
 *    an even newer marker has landed since - in which case the newer one
 *    stands (last write wins, exactly as it does between two writers).
 * 3. If it IS what we expected, drop the scratch and, for a replace, land
 *    `next` the same way - `link(staged → marker)`, so a marker that arrived
 *    in the meantime wins over the stamp instead of being overwritten by it.
 *
 * The one observable cost is a window between steps 1 and 3 in which the live
 * path is momentarily empty; a reader polling in that instant sees "no
 * marker" for one poll. That is strictly better than the failure modes it
 * replaces, where a live marker was erased or overwritten for the rest of its
 * update. Every step is guarded: `rm` with `force` still rejects on EACCES /
 * EPERM / EBUSY, and this is advisory state that must never fail the update.
 * The outer catch is the contract; the inner ones choose the right outcome.
 *
 * Leftovers are bounded and inert: a process killed mid-swap leaves at most
 * one `.reconcile-*` (and a stamp at most one `.tmp-*`) beside the marker,
 * and nothing reads those paths - the host daemon and this module read the
 * live path only. They are deliberately NOT swept here: a sweep keyed on age

 * creation stamp that could not be read back. The two predicates below read
 * this from opposite sides: what cannot be proven abandoned is not replaced
 * outside the lock, and what cannot be proven live is not put back.
 *
 * A pid alone is not the writer. The OS reuses pids, so an updater that
 * crashed after publishing its marker can leave a pid that some unrelated
 * process holds by the time the next `host update` reads it - and a
 * liveness probe then vouches for a writer that no longer exists (the
 * pre-lock claim defers to it, and a park restores its marker as a proven
 * live one). A record that carries the writer's creation stamp is therefore
 * held to `verifyProcessIdentity`, the same verdict the CLI lock and the
 * host's `pid.json` are judged by: `alive-same` (the pid is alive AND was
 * created when the writer was) is `live`; `dead` and `alive-different` (an
 * impostor behind a recycled pid) are `dead`; `indeterminate` is `unknown`.
 * A record without a stamp - written by a CLI before the field existed, or
 * by one whose probe failed at the write - is judged by the pid alone,
 * which is the most that record can be held to; the host daemon judges
 * every record that way today. That residual retires with those CLIs: a
 * marker lives for one update attempt.
 *
 * The stamped path is strictly NARROWER than the pid-only one, on purpose:
 * a pid the OS proves alive whose stamp cannot be read back (`powershell`
 * refused or past its timeout, `ps` past its) is `unknown`, not `live` -
 * the claim still defers to it, but the takeover does not retain it and a
 * park does not put it back, and its writer, if live, re-asserts its own
 * marker under the lock. Do not re-widen it "for safety": `live` is what

/**
 * The pre-lock publish: claim the live path for `next` WITHOUT overwriting
 * an update that may be in progress.
 *
 * `host update` publishes its `updating` before it waits for the contender
 * lock, so the transfer is visible remotely from its first byte. That write
 * used to be the one unconditional write on the path, and it could land over
 * the marker of the updater currently HOLDING the lock - mid-swap, mid-
 * restart - after which that updater's stamp and clear (CAS against its own
 * record) could never land, and this run's `failed` on a lost download
 * would stand over a live mutation as a terminal outcome. The rule is the
 * same one the lock-holder applies under the lock: nothing is overwritten
 * blind.
 *
 * - `published`: the path was empty and `next` is now there;
 * - `replaced-stale`: the path held a record no writer is acting on
 *   (`updateProgressRecordHasLiveWriter` false - a `failed`, or an
 *   `updating` whose writer process is gone) and `next` replaced it by
 *   compare-and-swap. The replaced record is gone, not kept for a later
 *   restore: see `updateProgressRecordHasLiveWriter` for why putting it
 *   back would be worse than the blind publish it replaces;
 * - `deferred`: the path holds another writer's live `updating`. Nothing
 *   was written; the caller runs without a marker of its own until it
 *   takes the marker over under the lock. Also the answer when concurrent
 *   writers kept winning the bounded retry - someone live is writing - and
 *   for a file this CLI cannot read or does not recognise as a record
 *   (`MarkerRead`: a foreign shape, an unreadable file), which is left
 *   standing;
 * - `failed`: an I/O failure after which nothing of `next` landed. The
 *   record it was replacing may have been displaced into a retained
 *   scratch when neither restore route could land (`ConditionalMarker*`,
 *   warned about by name); the caller does not hold a record of its own
 *   either way.
 *
 * The liveness check is synchronous (`probeProcessLiveness`; on Windows a
 * `tasklist` spawn with a bounded timeout - and, for a record that carries
 * a creation stamp whose pid is not proven dead, one more bounded spawn to
 * read the stamp back: `ps` on macOS, `powershell` on Windows) and runs
 * once per record read: at most three times per claim call. Per `host
 * update` that is at most eight checks - at most sixteen bounded spawns on
 * Windows, eight on macOS, none on Linux (`/proc` reads), plus one to read
 * this process's own stamp; the marker lock adds none (its metadata is the
 * cached own-process reads) - the claim can run twice (a claim that
 * deferred at
 * `onWillDownload` claims again before the work), the takeover under the
 * lock reads once (only on the iteration that replaces), and the restore a
 * park or a pre-disruption failure performs reads once. Never throws.
