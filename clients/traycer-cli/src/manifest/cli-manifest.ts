// legacy/no-slot dev, and ~/.traycer/cli/dev-runs/<slot>/manifest.json for
// multi-run dev. Read by the CLI itself on every install/update/uninstall to
// know what state it's already in; written atomically via rename so a crash
// mid-install can't leave a partially-written file.
//
// `pendingUpgrade` records that a newer CLI binary has been downloaded

// process is expected to detect a pending upgrade, finalise it (swap
// binaries + update top-level fields), and clear the field.
//
// Absence of a manifest file means "no recorded install on this environment
// yet" - readCliManifest() returns null for that state rather than
// fabricating a half-populated manifest, since the persisted contract
// requires every top-level field to be present.
