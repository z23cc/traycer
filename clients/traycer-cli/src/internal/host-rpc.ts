 * Why this exists rather than each call site naming a schema: the transport
 * hands back a payload already at the client's canonical version - either the
 * host spoke it directly (returned unvalidated, so this parse IS the validation
 * boundary) or `upgradeResponseAlongChain` bridged an older host's reply up to
 * it. A call site that names an older `...SchemaVNN` therefore validates the
 * wrong contract AND, because Zod strips unknown keys, silently discards every
 * field added since - turning a host fact the CLI was told into one it never
 * saw. That skew is invisible to the type checker, because `parseHostResponse`
 * takes `value: unknown` and returns whatever the schema it was handed infers.
 *
 * Naming the METHOD alongside the schema is what closes that hole. The schema
 * parameter is typed as the method's canonical `ResponseOfMethod` - the same
 * type `callHostRpc` already promises for the value being parsed - so handing
 * it a stale `...SchemaVNN` is a compile error at the call site instead of a
 * silent field drop at runtime. When a protocol minor lands, every CLI call
 * site on that method stops compiling until someone decides what the new field
 * means here, which is the loud, reviewable moment the old signature never had.
 * `assertCanonicalResponseSchema` covers the residue the types cannot see.
 *

 * specific historical version - the streaming frame bridge in `monitor.ts`

/**
 * The attestation window a call gets is a function of what it could do with an
 * attestation.
 *
 * A retrying call gets the production window: the CLI's 15s response deadline
 * is half the host's 30s post-`openAck` deadline - and a stalled host fires that
 * timer later still - so without the window every stalled host would surface an
 * ambiguous, non-retryable timeout long before it could attest that it never
 * dispatched the request, and the retry wrapper would never get its one safe
 * reason to redial a non-idempotent method.
 *
 * A `maxRetries: 0` policy has no such reason to wait. Its retry wrapper goes
 * straight to the final attempt and propagates even a valid
 * `RetryableTransportError` without redialing, so holding the socket open for an
 * attestation would only delay a failure that is already decided - exactly what
 * `callHostRpcFastFail`'s latency-bound IDE-hook callers must not pay. Keyed off
 * `maxRetries` rather than policy identity so any future no-retry policy
 * inherits the same wiring.
