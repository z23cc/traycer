// The progress-marker lock as a doctor probe. `host update` takes a short
// cross-process lock beside `update-progress.json` around each conditional
// write of the marker (create / replace / clear), waits a bounded time for
// it, and answers `failed` for a write it could not make. The lock is held
// for one write - milliseconds, never across a download or a wait - so a
// holder that is still there on a second read is not a writer in flight:
// it is a hung updater, or a lock whose holder cannot be verified and so is
// never broken by the acquisition path. Either way every later update's
// marker step fails, and the only artifact that explains it is this file.
//
// A STALE lock is not a fault by itself: a holder that has exited, a pid
// that was recycled, and an empty file past its grace window are all broken
// by the next acquisition on that evidence. What makes a stale lock a fault
// is a break-arbitration file (`<lock>.break`) that the acquisition cannot
// get past - a breaker that is alive or unverifiable, or a file dated in the
// future - so the probe reads that file too before it stays silent.
//
// Read-only. Doctor never breaks or removes either file: the acquisition
// path owns that, under its own arbitration, and only on positive evidence.
