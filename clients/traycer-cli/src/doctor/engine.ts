// ---- Identity plane ------------------------------------------------------ //

// Reads the host's IDENTITY-plane needs-reauth marker, and is honest about
// what reading it can and cannot settle.
//
// Everything above this line is the AUTH plane: the host's own delegated
// credential under `<host home>/auth/`, which a connected owner client
// re-provisions. This marker lives under `<identity home>/identity/` and means
// something else - the host's coordination identity paused after a credential
// refresh was rejected - and it clears when a user bearer NEWER than the
// marker lands in the shared CLI credentials file, i.e. when somebody signs in
// again here. Two planes, two markers of the same name, opposite repairs.
//
// WHY THIS ONE CANNOT REPORT CLEAN. A host resolves its identity home as
// `devIdentityHomeOverride ?? <host home>`, and the override is installed
// inside the host process by the dev identity pool walk - not in a file, not
// in an env var this CLI is spawned with, not derivable from any path here. On
// a pool machine the marker this probe is looking for may sit under
// `~/.traycer/host/dev/identities/<name>/identity/`, and which `<name>` a
// running host took is knowledge that exists only in that process. An
// ENOENT-is-clean probe would therefore report a stranded dev-pool host as
// healthy, which is the environment the original incident was filed from.
//
// So the answer is scoped rather than asserted: a marker found here is
// reported, a marker that cannot be found here is reported as NOT VERIFIED
// whenever this host could actually have taken a pool identity (see
// `identityHomeUnverifiedIssue` for the two negatives that rule that out),
// and the host's own `host.doctor` - the only party that resolves the live
// identity home - substitutes its own verdict for every code this function
// emits.

/**
 * The scope caption: no marker in the default identity home, and what that is
 * worth.
 *
 * `null` - genuine silence - whenever the pool walk that installs an identity
 * override could not have run, because then the absence just read IS the whole
 * answer. Two independent negatives establish that, and each one alone is
 * enough:
 *
 * 1. THE ENVIRONMENT IS NOT `dev`. The host's own gate opens with
 *    `config.environment !== "dev" -> not-applicable`
 *    (`lifecycle/dev-identity-pool.ts`), so a production host always falls
 *    back to its own host home no matter what the pool contains. Spelled
 *    `!== "dev"` rather than `=== "production"` to mirror that gate exactly:
 *    `Environment` is an open string alias, and a future slot must be
 *    ineligible until something deliberately makes it eligible. Without this,
 *    one developer's internal `make dev-desktop` pool would caption every
 *    PRODUCTION doctor run on their machine forever - false uncertainty about
 *    a home that process cannot use, which is the same noise this gate exists
 *    to avoid, only pointed the other way.
 * 2. THERE IS NO POOL. With no identity seated under
 *    {@link hostDevIdentityPoolRoot}, no host here can hold an overridden
 *    identity home even on a dev build.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT mirrored is the host's second gate,
 * `isEffectiveHomeCanonical()`. It reads the host's EFFECTIVE home, which
 * honours a `--host-data-dir` this CLI cannot see: a dev host launched
 * manually into a non-canonical directory looks canonical from here while
 * being fully pool-eligible. Suppressing on a canonical-looking dev home would
 * therefore report exactly that host clean, so `dev` stays conservative.
 *
 * The pool root is read for EXISTENCE, never attributed: which identity a
 * running host took is not recorded anywhere this CLI can see.
