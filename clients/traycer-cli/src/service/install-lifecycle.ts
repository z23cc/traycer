//     post-swap (Core Flow 1 / Flow 7 - `host install` on a clean
//     machine) or skip touching the service (`host update`, which
//     assumes the service is already there). `externally-managed`
//     (macOS, SMAppService-owned label) always skips the service work:
//     Desktop owns that registration and the CLI must not touch it.
//   - `stoppedBeforeSwap` - true iff we issued `controller.stop()`
//     because the service was running (or because Windows needs a
//     force-kill of stray host processes before the install-dir
//     rename). Used for reporting only; the post-swap path no longer
//     branches on it.
//   - `postSwapAction` - what we actually attempted after the swap.
//     `install` when we rewrote/re-registered the OS service manifest
//     (fresh bootstrap or an existing registration that needs the
//     regenerated definition), `none` if not registered and bootstrap
//     was off. Plain start/restart is intentionally not used after a
//     binary swap: on macOS those only kickstart launchd's cached
//     definition and would leave SoftResourceLimits / ProgramArguments
//     stale.
//   - `postSwapError` - non-null iff the post-swap install threw. Per
//     the Tech Plan we do NOT rollback in this case; the new host
//     stays installed and the operator is steered toward
//     `traycer host doctor`.
