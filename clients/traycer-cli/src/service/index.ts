/**
 * Decorator order is load-bearing: the invocation-record decorator is the
 * OUTER one. Its uninstall first validates the state directory and acquires
 * the record transaction, and either can fail before the OS backend is ever
 * called. Were the stop-intent decorator outside it, that failure would
 * happen with a stop intent already published - and `retireIntentIfHostSurvived`
 * deliberately keeps the intent when the host cannot be reached, so a
 * supervisor would sit silenced for the intent's lifetime with no uninstall
 * having occurred. Inside the transaction, the intent is announced only once
 * the backend uninstall is actually about to run.
 *
 * The one thing that runs before BOTH is the Linux cgroup guard: the outer
 * decorator's uninstall re-runs it ahead of acquiring the transaction, so a
 * refusal neither publishes an intent nor invalidates the record.
