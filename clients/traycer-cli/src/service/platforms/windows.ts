// rename fails with EBUSY. Kill the processes a slot-scoped scan verifies by
// exe path/command line - that covers the recorded pid.json host too, when it
// is genuinely still the host.
//
// There is no unverified fallback. An unreadable scan used to degrade to
// `taskkill` on the pid.json pid, which is both weaker than it looks (Windows
// may have recycled that pid for an unrelated process) and, worse, silent: the
// caller went on to delete the pid metadata and report the host stopped while
// descendants the fallback never enumerated kept running and kept the install
// dir open. Every exit below therefore either PROVES the slot is empty with a
// scan or throws. Refusing before anything is killed is the safer half of that
// trade: a stop that cannot be verified leaves the tree whole for the next
// attempt instead of half torn down.
//
// NEVER a tree kill (`taskkill /T`). This CLI is routinely a CHILD of the host
// it is stopping - a maintenance RPC, the reconciler, or a person's command in
// a Traycer-hosted terminal - and a tree kill walks down from the host and
// kills it mid-update: the host is gone, the updater is gone, and nothing
// finishes the swap. The scan computes which pids to kill
// (`computeWindowsHostKillSet`) and each one is killed individually, deepest
// first (`orderWindowsKillsDescendantsFirst`) so a child is issued its kill
// before the parent whose death would orphan it. That ordering is a courtesy,
// not a mechanism - a process spawned after the snapshot is in no ordering of
// this list, and what actually catches it is the victim carry-over below.
// `TerminateProcess` on a parent leaves its children running, the VBS launcher
// re-runs the host only on exit 75 (the refreshed-slot signal) and never after a
// kill, and the CLI-side supervisor is already silenced by the stop intent
// written before any of this.
//
// Killed by IDENTITY, not by pid. The scan proves a row is the host's by its
// pid AND its creation time, but a pid is only a name: a victim can exit on its
// own between the snapshot and the kill - an agent does the moment the pipe to
// its just-killed host closes - and Windows hands pids out again eagerly.
// `taskkill /F /PID` re-resolves the integer at kill time,
// so in that window it terminates whatever now wears the number: a process the
// scan never saw, which the carry-over cannot protect because it only reasons
// about rows that were in a snapshot. `killProcessIdentities` therefore hands
// each round's victims to ONE PowerShell script that opens a handle to the pid,
// checks the creation time through that handle against the one the scan
// recorded, and terminates through the same handle. An open handle keeps the
// process object - and with it the pid - alive, so the process the check
// passed is the process the kill reaches. A mismatch is a reused pid and is
// skipped; the next scan lists whatever is really there. A victim whose
// creation time the scan could not read (0) is skipped for the same reason -
// there is no identity to check - and surfaces as a survivor if it persists;
// no live slot process is known to lack one (pid 0 and System have none, and
// neither is ever in a kill set).
//
// Not a tree kill also means nothing sweeps up what is spawned DURING the
// kill. The scan is a snapshot, so a child the host or one of its agents
// starts after `Get-CimInstance` materializes the table is in no round's kill
// set; killing its parent orphans it, and the caller goes on to delete the pid
// metadata while it still holds the install dir open. So this rescans and
// kills again until a scan comes back empty. Each round kills exactly what
// THAT round's scan returned - the scan verifies by exe path/command line, so
// a pid Windows recycled between rounds is simply not in it.
//
// `WINDOWS_KILL_CONVERGENCE_ROUNDS` counts KILL passes, so the loop scans one
// more time than it kills: the last scan is always a confirming one, and an
// empty scan is the ONLY way out that reports success.
//
// Known and deliberately not mechanised: `TerminateProcess` is asynchronous -
// the confirming scan can briefly still list a pid the previous round killed.
// The bound absorbs one such round (that pid is gone by the next scan and the
// loop converges normally). If the live Windows run shows this flaking, the
// lever is a short settle before the re-scan, NOT a wider bound: more rounds

/**
 * The handle-bound kill, as a Windows PowerShell 5.1 script over `targets`.
 *
 * Per target, in order: `GetProcessById` (throws when nothing wears the pid),
 * then `.Handle`, which opens a process handle and caches it on the object.
 * From that line on the kernel keeps the process object alive for as long as
 * the handle is open, so the pid cannot be reused underneath us, and every
 * later member call on the object - `StartTime`, `Kill` - goes through that
 * same cached handle rather than re-resolving the pid. `StartTime` is then
 * normalised the way the table scan normalises `CreationDate`
 * (`ROW_CREATION_SCRIPT_LINES`): UTC, ticks since the Unix epoch, truncated to
 * microseconds. Both come from the kernel's creation FILETIME, so for one and
 * the same process they agree to the microsecond. A match is the scan's
 * process and is killed; anything else is skipped and reported, and the
 * confirming scan says what that pid really is now.
 *
 * NOT the scan's `Ticks / 10` though. The scan's ticks are multiples of 10 by
 * construction - CIM carries `CreationDate` as a DMTF datetime with six
 * fractional digits - so its division is exact and PowerShell keeps it a
 * `[long]`. `StartTime` keeps the FILETIME's 100 ns digit, and PowerShell's
 * `/` on a non-exact `[long]` quotient goes through `[double]`, whose
 * precision past 2^53 (ticks since 1970 passed that in 1998, and pass 2^54
 * in January 2027, where it halves again) is 2 ticks: a `...9` rounds up to
 * `...10`, the floor lands one microsecond high, and an
 * exact comparison refuses to kill the host - every stop, for as long as that
 * host lives, with nothing above DEBUG to say why. Falsification, on Windows
 * PowerShell 5.1: `[long][math]::Floor([long]17870000000000019 / 10)` prints
 * `1787000000000002`. `($t - ($t % 10)) / 10` is integer arithmetic
 * throughout. The comparison then allows a difference of 1 µs, which absorbs
 * WMI rounding rather than truncating its last digit; it admits no stranger,
 * because a reused pid is born after the victim exited, which is after the
 * scan that saw the victim alive - never within a microsecond of the
 * victim's own birth.
 *
 * `.Handle` asks for full access to the process. Same-user processes at the
 * same integrity level grant it, which is every process the host and its
 * agents are; the case that refuses it - an elevated host from an unelevated
 * CLI - refuses `PROCESS_TERMINATE` too, so nothing `taskkill /F` could have
 * ended is out of reach here. A refusal is reported as `failed`, and the
 * survivor shows up in the confirming scan like any other.
 *
 * Every statement inside the `try` is a .NET member access, and those throw
 * terminating errors whatever `$ErrorActionPreference` says; the setting is
 * there so nothing outside the `try` can half-succeed silently either.
 * PowerShell wraps a member's exception - `MethodInvocationException` for a
 * method, `GetValueInvocationException` for a property getter such as
 * `.Handle` - and both derive from `RuntimeException`, which is what the
 * catch unwraps so the report names the real cause (`ArgumentException` is
 * "not running").
 *
 * The literal holds only integers this module produced (`WindowsKillTarget`
 * from the scan's own JSON), never text, so there is nothing to quote and no
 * argument-injection surface.

 *
 * The host is slot-matched AND an ancestor of a host-spawned CLI, so subtracting
 * the slot from the spared ancestors is what keeps it in the kill set: "exclude
 * the updater's ancestry" would spare the very process this stop exists to
 * terminate. What the ancestor clause actually protects is a Traycer-hosted
 * TERMINAL run, where the shell and its conpty sit between the host and this
 * CLI and match nothing.
 *
 * `cliPid` is the CLI's own pid. Not PowerShell's: the scan runs as this
 * process's child, so `$PID` inside it is a descendant of the answer, and
 * seeding from it spares the branch above the CLI while leaving the CLI's own
 * siblings - the detached upgrade finalizer among them - to be killed.
 *
 * `memory` is what the kill loop remembers from its earlier rounds. Its victims
 * exist because killing a parent DESTROYS the evidence linking its children to
 * the slot. A process the host spawned after round 0's snapshot shows up in
 * round 1 with its parent already dead: the table cannot vouch for that edge, so
 * the row arrives with `parentProcessId` 0, and if the child is a shell or a
 * provider binary its own path matches nothing. It would be an orphan the loop
 * calls convergence on. A row whose CLAIMED parent is a remembered victim, and
 * whose birth falls inside that victim's known lifetime, is therefore treated as
 * a descendant of a verified slot process - seeded, not merely walked to. See
 * `classifyAgainstVictim` for why a lifetime, and why a claim that falls outside
 * it is reported rather than decided.
 *
 * Its suspects are the same memory for rows an earlier round could not place.
 * They carry no verdict, only the fact that the pid is in question: a row
 * claiming one is undecided too (`classifyAgainstSuspect`), because deciding it
 * would mean deciding its parent, which is the thing this loop already said it
 * could not do.
 *
 * `undecided` carries those undecidable rows out to the caller, TOGETHER WITH
 * EVERYTHING BELOW THEM, walked over the same validated edges as the kill set.
 * An undecided root makes its whole subtree undecided - those children are
 * verified children of a process we cannot place, so they are exactly as
 * unplaceable - and naming only the root would send the caller after one pid
 * while the rest of the branch keeps the install dir open. They are all spared
 * from `kill` (killing on a claim we cannot verify is the mistake this scan
 * exists to prevent), and the loop must not read their absence from `kill` as
 * convergence, because a host child spawned just before its parent died looks
 * exactly like this.
 *
 * Precisely: `undecided` is that closure minus everything the loop is about to
 * remember with a window (`kill` and `protectedAncestors`) and minus the CLI's
 * own descendant branch, which is positively identified and never the host's
 * even when its slot-matched scan lands in the closure under an undecided CLI.
 * `unattributed` is `undecided` minus the CLI's uncertain ancestors as well -
 * what the loop reports, as opposed to what it remembers.

// round that reads the age validates the same edge. That later reading is new
// evidence and outranks the earlier suspicion, which is why nothing here keeps a
// row undecided by its own identity once its edge validates. Uncertainty about
// a child whose LIVE parent is itself undecided is preserved by the descendant
// closure in `computeWindowsHostKillSet`, not here; and once that parent has
// exited, by the suspect entry the loop recorded for it - for every member of
// the closure outside the CLI's own descendant branch - its uncertain
// ancestors included - so a child that outlives a spared shell still finds its
// parent's pid remembered.
//
// The gate is NOT redundant with the rules below. The case it decides is a

// Resolve the Task XML `<UserId>` value. schtasks requires a fully
// qualified `<domain>\<name>` for domain-joined machines and accepts a
// bare `<name>` for local accounts. We can't easily distinguish the two
// from inside Node without Win32 API calls, so we lean on the env vars
// that the shell sets at logon:
//   - USERDOMAIN + USERNAME both set, non-empty → `<domain>\<name>`
//   - USERNAME only → bare `<name>` (local-account path)
//   - neither → fail closed; missing identity would produce a Task XML
//     that schtasks rejects with a confusing error
//
// TODO(microsoft-account-sid): For users signed in with a Microsoft
// account, Windows exposes the identity as a SID
// (`S-1-12-1-...`) reached through the LookupAccountName / NetUserGetInfo
// Win32 APIs. That requires a native helper out of scope for this fix.
// The current heuristic is correct for the local + domain-joined
// majority; MSA users will see the bare USERNAME fallback, which
// schtasks usually accepts for their local profile.
