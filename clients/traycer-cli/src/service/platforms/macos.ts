// `service install --takeover`: explicit-consent move of host management

//      host proceeds (it is the broken part; the takeover is the recovery).
//   2. Bootout of Desktop's agent registration, verified by re-probe - a
//      bootout that silently failed must not let install continue into
//      the agent refusal with a confusing second error.
//   3. Return, letting the caller run the normal `install` path.
//
// The takeover holds until the Desktop app next runs an SMAppService
// register cycle (an app relaunch may re-register its agent); the info log
// says so, because "my host went back to the app" is otherwise
// undiagnosable from the shell.
//
// The whole decision, by the two labels' `launchctl print` evidence
// (`probeLabelForTakeover`: absent | indeterminate | loaded{ownership,
// running, pid}). Two invariants hold in every cell: no process is booted
// out without a cooperative claim made while ITS label held the machine's
// only process - the claim follows `pid.json`, so the residual is a host
// run by hand outside launchd racing a label's host, itself the dual-host
// state, and a process launchd starts between a probe and the bootout that
// follows it, microseconds old - and no replacement is registered while a
// process of the evicted job, or a host `pid.json` names, may be alive.

  //      process, and every claim below can reach only that label's host -
  //      or a host run by hand outside launchd (rule 3).
  //   2. In the took-over arm the claim before the agent's bootout is
  //      skipped when the CLI label is the one with a process: that host is
  //      asked by the stand-down after the agent is gone, with a claim that

  //      other case the claim is made even for an idle agent, because a
  //      hand-run host may be what `pid.json` names and it must be asked.
  //   3. Nothing is registered while `pid.json` still names a live process

  //      claims could not stop and the bootouts could not reach - one run by

//
// `no-metadata` and `no-host` while launchd reports a process (a positive
// pid, or `state = running` with none printed) both REFUSE instead of
// proceeding. launchd's pid is the supervisor; `pid.json` names its host
// child. A supervisor that is alive while the metadata is absent, or names a
// child that is gone, is a host in its first seconds (fresh start, or a
// respawn after the old child exited and before the new one published) -
// there is no endpoint to ask yet, and booting it out now is the very
// interruption this guard exists to prevent. The window closes on its own;
// the caller retries. Only a host that answered - stood down, or is
// provably unreachable behind a published endpoint - lets the reload run.
//
// A job that is loaded with NO process is not left for the caller either.
// It is either idle for good (a clean exit: `traycer host stop`, or a child
// that declined to an incumbent, which `KeepAlive{SuccessfulExit: false}`
// never respawns) or inside launchd's throttle window before a respawn, and
// the two cannot be told apart from `launchctl print`. Left loaded, the
// throttled one can start while `installService` writes its launcher and
// manifest, after which the install's bare bootout interrupts a host that
// was never asked (Codex, traycer#1761, round 3). So the job is unloaded
// HERE, under this lock, through `unloadCliLabelJob`: once it is verified
// gone nothing can start under the label - launchd does not spawn an
// unloaded job, another CLI is excluded by the contender lock, and a
// Desktop SMAppService load of this label is the pre-split refusal the
// install re-checks - and the install's own probe then reads it as
// `not-loaded` and skips its bootout. What remains is the gap between
// launchd answering the probe and the `bootout --wait` reaching it,
// normally microseconds; a process launchd starts inside it is terminated
// by that bootout without a claim, at an age where it has no client and no
// work to lose.
//
// `retiredAgentLabelId` names Desktop's agent when the took-over arm calls
// this after deregistering it; the refusals then say so, because at that
// point the machine's only registration is the one being refused and the
// re-run that finishes the takeover must be spelled out. Both callers refuse

/**
 * The repair counterpart to `installService`'s agent refusal: that stops a
 * competing CLI registration from being CREATED, this removes one that
 * already exists.
 *
 * Both halves of the dual-registration bug are needed to reach this state,
 * and both shipped in v1.1.7: the label split let a CLI-label job coexist
 * with Desktop's `<label>.agent` SMAppService job (launchd sees no
 * collision), and the ownership probe was blind to the `launchctl print`
 * format current macOS emits - so every guard that should have refused the
 * second registration passed. Machines that ran `host install` /
 * `host status` / `host ensure` in a terminal during that window carry two
 * `RunAtLoad` registrations and start two hosts at every login. Neither the
 * v1.1.8 classifier fix nor the supervisor's incumbent guard cleans that up:
 * the classifier only prevents new ones, and at login both jobs start
 * simultaneously - `pid.json` does not exist yet, so neither sees an
 * incumbent to defer to.
 *
 * Preconditions, both required, both probed here rather than inferred from
 * the caller's `ServiceState` (which folds two very different machines into
 * one `externally-managed` value):
 *
 *   1. The AGENT label is SMAppService-owned - positive proof Desktop owns
 *      registration and a host will still start at login after we retire
 *      the CLI one. Without this the CLI label may be the machine's only
 *      host, and retiring it would leave no host at all.
 *   2. The CLI label is NOT SMAppService-owned. When it is, that IS
 *      Desktop's registration on a pre-label-split machine, and
 *      bootout/manifest-removal against the raw path would corrupt the BTM
 *      state Desktop manages - the exact thing `installService`'s first
 *      refusal exists to prevent.
 *
 * The manifest is removed even when the bootout failed: "does not come back
 * at the next login" is the durable half of the repair and is worth having
 * on its own. That deliberately can leave a loaded job with no backing file,
 * which is harmless - launchd holds the job definition in memory, so the
 * orphaned job keeps running (and keeps `KeepAlive`-respawning on crash)
 * until logout, which is exactly the intended "converges at next login"
 * outcome. The ordering is therefore not load-bearing in either direction.
 * Unlike `uninstallService`, removing the manifest here cannot make
 * `statusService` misreport a still-loaded job as `not-installed` - its
 * agent-label probe returns `externally-managed` before it ever looks at the
 * manifest.
 *
 * AVAILABILITY: a successful bootout - which waits for the evicted process
 * to actually exit - is followed by a best-effort `kickstart` of the agent
 * label, because precondition 1 proves the agent job is LOADED, not that it
 * has a live process. On this exact cohort it
 * frequently does not: both jobs are `RunAtLoad`, so at login they race, the
 * loser declines via `findLiveIncumbentHost` and exits 0, and
 * `KeepAlive{SuccessfulExit:false}` never respawns a clean exit - leaving
 * that job loaded-but-dead for the rest of the session. When the decliner
 * was the agent, the CLI-label job we are about to evict is the machine's
 * ONLY live host, and nothing downstream would start another: this branch
 * sets `postSwapAction: "none"`, and nothing else in this install path
 * kickstarts the agent label on precisely this machine. The
 * kickstart also makes the just-swapped bytes go live immediately instead of
 * at the next login.
 *
 * Never throws: every failure is logged and folded into the returned
 * summary. This runs as a side effect of an install the user asked for, so
 * it must not be able to fail that install.

 * distinctions `inspectLaunchdOwnership` deliberately discards because for

 * launcher path, not merely a `traycer-host-start` basename suffix, since a
 * basename-only match would treat an attacker-writable plist pointing at
 * ANY same-named file as this label's registration and preserve whatever
 * command it named across the next `host update` - the prior inline
 * `/bin/sh -c <compat-script> <cli> <args...>` vector still on disk
 * wherever the definition has not been rewritten since, and the legacy
 * vector that ends at `host start`. There is deliberately no fourth branch
 * for a plist whose ProgramArguments end in `--service-label <label>` - no
 * version of `buildPlist` has ever emitted that shape, and a speculative
 * parse arm on a closed set is a liability, not tolerance.
